What You Need To Start Your Dropshipping Business Naturally, you need certain tools and resources to start a dropshipping business, but you also need to learn new concepts and develop the right mindset. That\u2019s what this chapter is all about. 4. Choosing Your Niche It\u2019s the million dollar question: how do you break into a profitable niche as a newbie? There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so intimidating: niche evaluation is really a specialized field of its own. You could spend months finding niche products, but that\u2019s not exactly practical for dropshipping. Luckily, there are tactics you can use to choose a great niche in a matter of weeks (or even days, though you shouldn\u2019t rush it). 5. Choosing the Right Products In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn the basics of selling products online and how to find the best dropshipping products for your niche.

As a whole, branding far exceeds the scope of this guide, but I\u2019ll get into the basics to get you started. First I\u2019ll define what a brand is, and then I\u2019ll show you what you need to focus on to brand your business. 9. Finding & Dealing With Suppliers Finding the right dropshipping suppliers takes some caution, so it\u2019s crucial to use the right strategies. Some of these strategies are more effective than others, so I\u2019ll start with the one that\u2019s worked the best for me and then work my way down the list in this section. 10. Marketing Carefully planned marketing strategies are essential in ensuring the success of any dropshipping business, as it\u2019s marketing that drives traffic \u2013 and thus, sales \u2013 to your store.

You won\u2019t have to bend over backwards to get things done. Instead, you set your own pace. Dropshipping is also flexible in that it gives you a lot of room to make decisions that work for you. You can easily list new products whenever you want, and you can adjust your strategies on the fly. If you\u2019re going on vacation, you can automate everything to run while you\u2019re away.

Once you\u2019ve found suppliers and set everything up , you\u2019re mostly only responsible for your online storefront. Disadvantages of Dropshipping Disadvantages of Dropshipping \u00b6 Dropshipping has slim margins. One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you should expect low margins initially. That\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t be profitable, but you should be aware that the product margin in some niches might be small. This issue is especially problematic when you\u2019re dropshipping in a super-competitive niche . When you\u2019re fighting for customers\u2019 attention, you can\u2019t afford to make the kind of profits you want to. If you choose the right niche, you\u2019ll see larger margins. In niches with lower competition, you\u2019ll have better margins, but at some point sales will start to plateau. That\u2019s why dropshipping relies on a fair amount of sales to be profitable. Dropshipping can make order processing difficult. Dropshipping seems straightforward: The customer orders, you process, and your supplier fulfills. And for the most part, it is simple. However, if you\u2019re sourcing products from multiple suppliers, you might run into some problems. Each of your suppliers might use a different shipping solution, which presents a problem for both you and your customers. Costs can get high, and shipping multiple products can be problematic. Different suppliers will also have different structures in place for processing and billing. Since you have to manage the interaction with your suppliers, this can get tricky. Dropshipping doesn\u2019t give you a lot of control. One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you don\u2019t have much control over certain aspects of the dropshipping process such as stocking products, order fulfillment, and shipping. You have to rely on your suppliers to do everything right and work seamlessly. This lack of control can be off-putting to some entrepreneurs, but it usually isn\u2019t a problem. This just means that when something goes wrong, it can be tricky to manage. While supplier problems can sometimes cause customer retention issues, you can mitigate them and keep customer churn to an absolute minimum with the right damage control. Dropshipping makes customer service more challenging. This is another problem that happens when orders go wrong or suppliers fail. Because you\u2019re just the storefront and don\u2019t have a lot of control, it can be difficult to sort out orders and handle customer support. One of the most unfortunate disadvantages of dropshipping is that you have to take the blame when your customers complain. You could be doing everything right and still run into problems if your suppliers have issues. Is Dropshipping for You? \u00b6 Because there are both pros and cons of dropshipping, it isn\u2019t for everyone. This is especially true for people who are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme. Even if this isn\u2019t your approach, you still might have one of these fears: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have enough time to start a business.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk getting fired from my day job.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to work so hard on dropshipping that I underperform at my 9-to-5.\u201d That said, nearly anyone can build a dropshipping business because you can put as much or as little into dropshipping as you want. Here are two common approaches. Is Dropshipping Profitable? \u00b6 There are many ways to start and grow a dropshipping business.

A well-established dropshipping ecommerce business operates like clockwork, and it can even feel like you\u2019re generating passive income.

It doesn\u2019t take a degree in business or millions in capital to make a living from it. Plus, our dropshipping tutorial makes it easy to get started. The Dropshipping Process \u00b6 Now that we\u2019ve covered what dropshipping is, let\u2019s discuss exactly how it works. Here\u2019s a step-by-step overview of the entire dropshipping process as well as a look at what the customer experiences (and why it matters). what is dropshipping Understanding the Supply Chain \u00b6 In this guide, you\u2019ll see the term \u201c supply chain\u201d \u201d a lot. It sounds like fancy industry lingo, but it simply refers to how a product moves from supplier to customer. We\u2019ll use this to discuss the dropshipping process. the supply chain process Image source You, the retailer, are just one piece of the puzzle. A successful dropshipping operation relies on multiple parties all working together in sync. The supply chain is exactly that: the coordination of the manufacturer, supplier, and retailer. The supply chain can be broken down into three basic steps: The manufacturer creates the products and sells them in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers. Let\u2019s say Manufacturer A makes water bottles. After the bottles roll off the production line, they\u2019re sold in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers, who turn around and resell the bottles to retailers. Suppliers and wholesalers sell the products to retailers. A retailer like yourself searches out a supplier for a specific type of product. The retailer and supplier then enter into an agreement to work together. Image source A small note here: While you can buy directly from product manufacturers, it\u2019s often much easier to purchase from suppliers instead. Most manufacturers have minimum purchase requirements that can be rather high, and you\u2019d also have to store, stock, and ship the products. So, it might seem simpler to buy straight from the manufacturer, but you\u2019ll benefit most from buying from suppliers (and dealing with the slight markup). Suppliers are also convenient because many of them specialize in a certain niche, so you can easily find the kind of products you need. This also means you can get started selling super quickly. Retailers sell the products to consumers. Suppliers and wholesalers do not sell directly to the public; that\u2019s the retailer\u2019s job. The retailer is the final step between the product and the consumer. Retailers provide online storefronts from which consumers purchase products. After the wholesaler marks up the product, the retailer marks it up yet again to arrive at the final price. By \u201cmarkup,\u201d we\u2019re referring to setting a price that covers the cost price of the item and brings you a profit. That\u2019s it! That\u2019s the entire supply chain from start to finish. It\u2019s a straightforward but crucial concept in business. You might have noticed that no one specific party was referred to as a dropshipper. That\u2019s because \u201cdropshipper\u201d is not a specific role. Dropshipping is simply the action of shipping products for someone else. Manufacturers, suppliers, and merchants can all technically be dropshippers. Later in this guide, we\u2019ll cover how to start a dropshipping retail business. In other words, you\u2019ll learn how to become the merchant that purchases products from wholesalers to sell to the public. This could mean you sell via eBay or your own website with an online storefront. Now that you know what the supply chain looks like, consider what it\u2019s like for the customer. Dropshipping and Customer Experiences \u00b6 You\u2019ve bought products online hundreds of times before, but you\u2019ve probably never thought about the experience. It\u2019s second nature for consumers. As a customer, you don\u2019t need to think about it, but as a retailer, you absolutely should. Image source Retailers can learn a lot by thinking about the ideal customer experience of ordering from a retailer. This may seem obvious, but if there are any snags in the customer experience, it could spell trouble for you as a retailer. It\u2019s important to know what your buyers expect. Let\u2019s pretend you have a business called Fancy Water Bottles, a site called FancyWaterBottles.com, and a wholesaler called Water Bottles Worldwide. Here\u2019s what the ordering process would look like from the customer\u2019s perspective: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and immediately receives an email confirmation of the purchase. After a few hours and up to a couple of days, Customer A receives a notification that their order has shipped. The notification includes tracking information, so Customer A knows exactly where their package is while en route. Customer A receives the water bottle. It\u2019s the same process you\u2019ve gone through each time you\u2019ve purchased anything online. This seems basic, but there are two important aspects of this experience. First, it\u2019s simple. All the customer has to do is order the product and pay for it. Everything else, like an order confirmation email and tracking information, is handed to them on a silver platter. And that brings us to our second point: convenience. The buying experience is extremely convenient in every way. An online purchase takes just minutes to make, and customers can browse any retailer\u2019s site at their leisure. And if all goes well, the customer won\u2019t even have to interact with anyone. It takes the minimum amount of effort to achieve the desired result of getting a product. This experience is a lot like buying a water bottle at a big box store and using the self-checkout. It\u2019s a no-fuss process that doesn\u2019t present any problems. This is a big reason why people buy online in the first place, so your storefront has to give your customers that same level of convenience. Last but not least, the customer should never notice that any other parties besides the retailer are involved. Think about it. When you buy something online, you think, \u201cI bought a water bottle from Fancy Water Bottles.\u201d You don\u2019t consider where the retailer got the product or who might be shipping your order. To make the process seamless, the customer shouldn\u2019t be aware of all the stops their product makes. The package they receive will have your retail name on it, so as far as the customer is concerned, you fulfilled and shipped the order. This is how the dropshipping process should ideally look from the customer\u2019s point of view. Now, let\u2019s break down what happens on the other end. Dropshipping Behind the Scenes \u00b6 That\u2019s what the customer sees, but what is dropshipping like behind the scenes?. Here\u2019s an overview of the process: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and receives an email confirmation of the process. Let\u2019s say the total came to $14.95.Fancy Water Bottles receives the same email confirmation as well as Customer A\u2019s payment. This is usually made possible by automated software that sends out the confirmation to both buyer and seller. Fancy Water Bottles sends the order to Water Bottles Worldwide. Typically, a sales representative from Water Bottles Worldwide will receive and process the order. The retailer will then be charged for the purchase. For this example, let\u2019s say Water Bottles Worldwide charges $12.95 for each water bottle. The retailer will pay that amount, and the difference is the profit the retailer will make. In this case, the retailer will net a profit of $2.00. Water Bottles Worldwide packs up the order.Although the wholesaler ships the product, the package will be addressed from Fancy Water Bottles, and the Fancy Water Bottles name will appear on the invoice and packing slip. (This is so the customer will recognize the retailer\u2019s name on the package.) The wholesaler then sends an invoice and tracking information to the retailer. The retailer sends along the shipping information to the customer. This finalizes the retailer\u2019s role in the order process. The customer receives the package and enjoys the water bottle. That\u2019s the supply chain in action. You can see how the retailer, wholesaler, and manufacturer all have to work together flawlessly. When done right, it\u2019s a smooth process that results in minimal work for everyone involved. One point that needs to be stressed is that you, the retailer, are responsible only for two steps: sending orders to the supplier and shipment information to the consumer. Sometimes, you\u2019ll have to be responsible for other things like customer support, but if everything goes smoothly, those two steps are the only ones you have to complete. Getting Started With Dropshipping \u00b6 All of this sounds like a complicated puzzle, but once you learn how to dropship, it\u2019s a smooth process for everyone involved. You, the dropshipping merchant, can do everything remotely and never even touch a single product! Remember that you don\u2019t need any business experience to open a dropshipping storefront. It certainly helps, but it\u2019s not necessary. Many budding entrepreneurs don\u2019t ever chase their dreams because they believe they need an MBA or years\u2019 worth of experience. This is not the case. One of the benefits of dropshipping is that you can learn how to dropship as you go. Better yet, there are numerous resources that make dropshipping easier than ever before. For example, this useful video provides some great advice on getting started. You can have absolutely zero business experience and still easily make a profit. You\u2019ll need to learn the ropes along the way, and it will be challenging at times, but it\u2019s more than worth it. The question \u201cwhat is dropshipping?\u201d and all the basic things one should know before getting started have been answered. Now it\u2019s your turn to sleeve up and turn your dropshipping business plan into action. You may start small at the beginning with uncertainty and perhaps fear of failure, but all the successful entrepreneurs used to be at the same starting point. Draw up a strategic plan, evaluate opportunities and costs, and make your business dream happen. Want to Learn More? \u00b6 What Is Dropshipping?

After the bottles roll off the production line, they\u2019re sold in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers, who turn around and resell the bottles to retailers. Suppliers and wholesalers sell the products to retailers. A retailer like yourself searches out a supplier for a specific type of product. The retailer and supplier then enter into an agreement to work together. Image source A small note here: While you can buy directly from product manufacturers, it\u2019s often much easier to purchase from suppliers instead. Most manufacturers have minimum purchase requirements that can be rather high, and you\u2019d also have to store, stock, and ship the products. So, it might seem simpler to buy straight from the manufacturer, but you\u2019ll benefit most from buying from suppliers (and dealing with the slight markup). Suppliers are also convenient because many of them specialize in a certain niche, so you can easily find the kind of products you need. This also means you can get started selling super quickly. Retailers sell the products to consumers. Suppliers and wholesalers do not sell directly to the public; that\u2019s the retailer\u2019s job. The retailer is the final step between the product and the consumer. Retailers provide online storefronts from which consumers purchase products. After the wholesaler marks up the product, the retailer marks it up yet again to arrive at the final price. By \u201cmarkup,\u201d we\u2019re referring to setting a price that covers the cost price of the item and brings you a profit. That\u2019s it! That\u2019s the entire supply chain from start to finish. It\u2019s a straightforward but crucial concept in business. You might have noticed that no one specific party was referred to as a dropshipper. That\u2019s because \u201cdropshipper\u201d is not a specific role. Dropshipping is simply the action of shipping products for someone else. Manufacturers, suppliers, and merchants can all technically be dropshippers. Later in this guide, we\u2019ll cover how to start a dropshipping retail business. In other words, you\u2019ll learn how to become the merchant that purchases products from wholesalers to sell to the public. This could mean you sell via eBay or your own website with an online storefront. Now that you know what the supply chain looks like, consider what it\u2019s like for the customer.","title":"Understanding the Supply Chain"},{"location":"en/ch02/#dropshipping-and-customer-experiences","text":"You\u2019ve bought products online hundreds of times before, but you\u2019ve probably never thought about the experience. It\u2019s second nature for consumers. As a customer, you don\u2019t need to think about it, but as a retailer, you absolutely should. Image source Retailers can learn a lot by thinking about the ideal customer experience of ordering from a retailer. This may seem obvious, but if there are any snags in the customer experience, it could spell trouble for you as a retailer. It\u2019s important to know what your buyers expect. Let\u2019s pretend you have a business called Fancy Water Bottles, a site called FancyWaterBottles.com, and a wholesaler called Water Bottles Worldwide. Here\u2019s what the ordering process would look like from the customer\u2019s perspective: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and immediately receives an email confirmation of the purchase. After a few hours and up to a couple of days, Customer A receives a notification that their order has shipped. The notification includes tracking information, so Customer A knows exactly where their package is while en route. Customer A receives the water bottle. It\u2019s the same process you\u2019ve gone through each time you\u2019ve purchased anything online. This seems basic, but there are two important aspects of this experience. First, it\u2019s simple. All the customer has to do is order the product and pay for it. Everything else, like an order confirmation email and tracking information, is handed to them on a silver platter. And that brings us to our second point: convenience. The buying experience is extremely convenient in every way. An online purchase takes just minutes to make, and customers can browse any retailer\u2019s site at their leisure. And if all goes well, the customer won\u2019t even have to interact with anyone. It takes the minimum amount of effort to achieve the desired result of getting a product. This experience is a lot like buying a water bottle at a big box store and using the self-checkout. It\u2019s a no-fuss process that doesn\u2019t present any problems. This is a big reason why people buy online in the first place, so your storefront has to give your customers that same level of convenience. Last but not least, the customer should never notice that any other parties besides the retailer are involved. Think about it. When you buy something online, you think, \u201cI bought a water bottle from Fancy Water Bottles.\u201d You don\u2019t consider where the retailer got the product or who might be shipping your order. To make the process seamless, the customer shouldn\u2019t be aware of all the stops their product makes. The package they receive will have your retail name on it, so as far as the customer is concerned, you fulfilled and shipped the order. This is how the dropshipping process should ideally look from the customer\u2019s point of view. Now, let\u2019s break down what happens on the other end.","title":"Dropshipping and Customer Experiences"},{"location":"en/ch02/#dropshipping-behind-the-scenes","text":"That\u2019s what the customer sees, but what is dropshipping like behind the scenes?. Here\u2019s an overview of the process: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and receives an email confirmation of the process. Let\u2019s say the total came to $14.95.Fancy Water Bottles receives the same email confirmation as well as Customer A\u2019s payment. This is usually made possible by automated software that sends out the confirmation to both buyer and seller. Fancy Water Bottles sends the order to Water Bottles Worldwide. Typically, a sales representative from Water Bottles Worldwide will receive and process the order. The retailer will then be charged for the purchase. For this example, let\u2019s say Water Bottles Worldwide charges $12.95 for each water bottle. The retailer will pay that amount, and the difference is the profit the retailer will make. In this case, the retailer will net a profit of $2.00. Water Bottles Worldwide packs up the order.Although the wholesaler ships the product, the package will be addressed from Fancy Water Bottles, and the Fancy Water Bottles name will appear on the invoice and packing slip. (This is so the customer will recognize the retailer\u2019s name on the package.) The wholesaler then sends an invoice and tracking information to the retailer. The retailer sends along the shipping information to the customer. This finalizes the retailer\u2019s role in the order process. The customer receives the package and enjoys the water bottle. That\u2019s the supply chain in action. You can see how the retailer, wholesaler, and manufacturer all have to work together flawlessly. When done right, it\u2019s a smooth process that results in minimal work for everyone involved. One point that needs to be stressed is that you, the retailer, are responsible only for two steps: sending orders to the supplier and shipment information to the consumer. Sometimes, you\u2019ll have to be responsible for other things like customer support, but if everything goes smoothly, those two steps are the only ones you have to complete.","title":"Dropshipping Behind the Scenes"},{"location":"en/ch02/#getting-started-with-dropshipping","text":"All of this sounds like a complicated puzzle, but once you learn how to dropship, it\u2019s a smooth process for everyone involved.

You\u2019ve seen how easy it can be, and you\u2019re ready for the road ahead. So in this chapter, I\u2019ll tell you what you need to start dropshipping. Since a dropshipping retail business takes place completely online, you won\u2019t have to spend a whole lot, but you will need to plan well and think ahead. There are some misconceptions about what one needs to start a successful dropshipping business. Many people will tell you to just find a wholesaler, get a site up, and start selling. But that\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Businesses who take this approach often crash and burn in no time at all. Simply put, there are right and wrong ways to approach your dropshipping business. If you\u2019re trying to make money fast, your business will suffer. That\u2019s why I advocate a different perspective: the idea that dropshipping retailers should meet the needs of customers in a specific niche. Naturally, you\u2019ll need certain tools and resources to get started, but you\u2019ll also need to learn new concepts and develop the right mindset. You\u2019ll need to put tons of thought into how you want to set up your business and what goals you want to achieve. With that in mind, let\u2019s go over the must-haves for a successful dropshipping business. I\u2019ll delve into these in devoted chapters, but right now let\u2019s take a look at the big picture. Value \u00b6 Before you go looking for suppliers (and before you even choose a niche), you need to focus on value. This is something I\u2019m going to bring up regularly throughout this guide because it\u2019s such a crucial principle. value proposition Source Frankly, many dropshipping businesses don\u2019t care about value. Dropshipping has gained a somewhat bad reputation because many dropshipping retailers are just trying to outsell their competitors by offering cheaply made products. cheaply made products. To make matters worse, dropshippers will sometimes resort to shady tactics to sell and one-up the competition. All of this has led people to believe that it\u2019s a scammy practice, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. A dropshipping business is just like any other business, so it makes sense that you should approach dropshipping the way you\u2019d approach another kind of business. Sadly, many individuals overlook this. Ultimately, people quit dropshipping people quit dropshipping because they don\u2019t take the time to build a sturdy foundation. Thinking about value will help you start up a successful dropshipping business. It\u2019ll help you stand out from your competitors, and more importantly, you\u2019ll be focusing on the single most important aspect of any business, dropshipping or otherwise. The best way to focus on value is to build it into your dropshipping business from the start. Everything you do should add value to your audience in some way. If value is your number one priority, you\u2019ll be much more likely to get consumers\u2019 attention, and your business will last much longer than other dropshippers who just want to make a quick buck. Wondering how you can make value your priority? Well, there are some important questions you need to ask yourself before doing anything else: Who are you trying to help? What type of people do you want to reach, and what do they want? What niche(s) could you add value to? What kinds of products do customers in my niche want? How can I put my customers first? In short, the best way to provide value is to listen to your potential customers, find out what they want, and then give it to them. Your job is to give customers the best possible experience. Keeping value a priority has tangible benefits for your dropshipping business. Having this attitude will help you: Acquire and retain customers Grow a loyal customer base Stand out from your competitors Make your business unique and trustworthy Throughout this guide, you\u2019ll notice a consistent theme of adding value. It\u2019s important that you don\u2019t lose sight of this goal as you go on. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the rush of starting a business, but you have to remember to always keep value first. The Right Niche \u00b6 Have you ever wondered why so many dropshipping businesses are unsuccessful? Sometimes it can seem like retailers are dropping like flies, and it can be discouraging at first. But there are common mistakes that tons of dropshippers make. One of the biggest dropshipping failures dropshipping failures is choosing the wrong niche. That\u2019s right \u2013 one of the most common reason dropshipping retailers fail is because they chose the wrong niche. To understand why this happens, let\u2019s consider some common dropshipping niches: Phone accessories (especially cases) Clothing Beauty/cosmetics products Books Entertainment (e.g., movies, music, etc.) You\u2019ve probably seen a thousand different dropshipping businesses that offer at least one of these types of items. The problem? These niches are all extremely high competition. Think about dropshipping retailers that sell phone cases. If you want to buy phone cases online, you can choose from thousands and thousands of businesses. From Etsy to eBay and everywhere in between, there are too many phone case stores to count. If you want to sell phone cases, you\u2019ll have to go up against dropshipping stores who have been doing this for years. You\u2019ll have to cut through the noise, advertise like crazy, and hope people find you (and choose to buy from you). More importantly, it\u2019s hard to add real value to a niche like that. When you dropship, you\u2019re often choosing from the same products your competitors buy. That means you have to take an entirely different approach to adding value. The dropshipping niche you choose is a huge determining factor for value. If you choose a less popular niche, there\u2019s a good possibility you can step in and fill a need in that niche. But if you choose a niche that\u2019s super crowded, it\u2019s going to be almost impossible to differentiate yourself from your competitors (who have been around longer and are more popular). Of course, choosing the right niche is a crucial decision for any business, but many dropshipping businesses seem to completely overlook it. Most dropshippers assume that they can just choose a hot trend and jump on the bandwagon. When you\u2019re choosing a niche, there\u2019s a lot to consider. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve dedicated Chapter 4 Chapter 4 to helping you settle on a dropshipping niche. The Right Products \u00b6 Once you\u2019ve settled on a niche, it\u2019s time to take the next step and think about the kinds of products your store will offer. It\u2019s not as simple as choosing dropshipping products that seem popular. You need to be picky about your products. In order to establish a successful dropshipping business, you need to select your products carefully and base your choices on what your audience wants and needs. dropshipping product selection Image source Again, you have to think about value. While looking at bestselling products is a good place to start, it\u2019s not the be-all, end-all of product selection. You have to make sure the products you offer have significant value to your customer base. Many popular dropshipping products are only popular for a while. If you choose products that have lasting value, you\u2019ll be able to offer products that can stand the test of time. At the same time, you want to analyze product trends and use them to your advantage. If certain products have boomed over the last few months, they\u2019ll probably sell very well. Later in this guide, I\u2019ll show you how to analyze trends and figure out which products will be best for you. Once you start dropshipping products, you might decide to change the items you offer according to your audience\u2019s needs. Still, aim to start off strong and establish a line of products that will do well for you. Finally, bear in mind that product selection product selection is an ongoing process. You need to stay up-to-date with trends in your niche and change up your storefront accordingly. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing specific strategies for product research. Your goal is to use these strategies on a regular basis to optimize your store for sales and overall performance. An Incorporated Business \u00b6 Most suppliers and wholesalers require any business they work with to be legally incorporated. In fact, if you\u2019re not incorporated, most wholesalers won\u2019t show you their pricing or other details. That\u2019s how important it is. Remember, a dropshipping business is still a business. It should follow many of the same rules as a traditional business. Dropshipping may take place online, but it still needs to be conducted according to the law. If you don\u2019t follow these important rules, you\u2019ll run into problems. The bottom line: it\u2019s best to be incorporated before you even reach out to suppliers. benefits of incorporating Image source I\u2019ll cover this in more detail in Chapter 6, but for now, just remember that at some point, you\u2019re going to have to take the time to make sure your business is legal and good to go. Supplier(s) \u00b6 As you might have guessed, getting suppliers and wholesalers on board is an absolute necessity. Since you\u2019ll get your products directly from suppliers products directly from suppliers, you obviously want to work with companies that have a great track record and solid communication. You\u2019ll need to put some serious time and consideration into this part of the process. You don\u2019t want to choose the first wholesaler you see, and you also don\u2019t want to blindly go with the most popular suppliers you can find with a Google search. You\u2019ll have to weigh your options, compare prices, and make sure you have access to the dropshipping products you need. There are also certain protocols you\u2019ll need to follow when contacting wholesalers and making arrangements with them. Chapter 9 is entirely devoted to helping you find suppliers, so if this seems intimidating, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be addressing everything you need to know about choosing the right suppliers for your business. A Game Plan \u00b6 There\u2019s one last major ingredient you need: a game plan. By \u2018game plan\u2019, I mean a vision for your business and actionable steps to make that vision happen.

You want to get a sense of the big picture and then figure out the smaller details. It never hurts to be too thorough. Here are some areas to consider: Getting sales Taking a certain angle in your niche Digital marketing strategies Optimizing your online store This is also a good time to ask the tough questions so you can prepare yourself for them. For example, what if you\u2019re getting nowhere after 6 months? 1 year? It\u2019s not fun to think about these kinds of things, but doing so might save you from utter failure. Another question you might want to ask yourself is, \u201cIdeally, where do I want my business to go over the next X years?\u201d This is a more general dropshipping FAQ dropshipping FAQ that can help guide your vision. If you know exactly what you want, you can take steps toward making it happen. The more specific you get, the better. It might help you to draft up a business plan or even a flowchart that traces the ideal trajectory of your business. Getting Started \u00b6 So far, you haven\u2019t been able to actually do anything. I know it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s how every legendary business started out. But now, that\u2019s all going to change.

The first big decision you have to make is which niche products to offer. The best way to ensure that your business is successful is to think carefully about which niche is the best dropshipping niche for you. Settling on a niche is a bit more complicated than it seems. For dropshipping, you want to pick a niche that\u2019s profitable and that doesn\u2019t have insane levels of competition. That\u2019s the basic formula. The right research will help you do this, but it will take some time. If you already have a niche you\u2019re eyeballing, you need to analyze that niche from a retailer\u2019s perspective and consider how successful you\u2019d actually be in that niche. On the other hand, if you have no niche in mind, that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019ll be covering every step from researching the top dropshipping niches to narrowing down your options. I know it\u2019s tempting to find the hottest new niche and spend an afternoon setting up a store. In fact, that\u2019s what a large number of dropshippers do. They see which niche products are exploding and blindly hop on the bandwagon. However, this is not a good method. You might achieve runaway success for a while, but after that ends, you\u2019ll probably watch your business fall apart. This happens to almost every entrepreneur who capitalizes on the latest craze. A business model like that simply isn\u2019t meant to last, and my goal is to help you create a sustainable dropshipping retail career. If you want to turn dropshipping into a steadily flowing stream of income, you\u2019ll need to choose your niche carefully. In fact, niche selection is one of the most important business decisions you\u2019ll ever make. It sets the stage for everything else to follow. Think about it. The niche you choose will influence: What products you offer How much you sell Which suppliers you work with What marketing strategies you use How successful your business will ultimately be It\u2019s a big decision, and it\u2019s not one to be taken lightly. Too often, dropshippers realize the niche they chose isn\u2019t working out, and they have to go back square one. That can be a colossal waste of time, money, and other important resources, especially if you\u2019ve been at it for a while. The more thought you put into selecting a niche, the sturdier your business will be. You won\u2019t doubt yourself a few months down the road. And that\u2019s what this chapter is all about: helping you find the best dropshipping niche for your business. I find that a lot of success with dropshipping comes from asking the right questions. So without further ado, let\u2019s look at the most important questions you need to ask yourself when selecting a niche. How to Evaluate Dropshipping Niche Ideas \u00b6 Choosing a niche can be confusing. There are millions of niches, so it\u2019s tricky to know which ones are viable. To make matters worse, many of those niches have established businesses you\u2019d be competing directly against. It\u2019s the million dollar question: how do you break into a profitable niche as a newbie? When you\u2019re thinking about this, it may seem like every niche is saturated, but that\u2019s not true. There are niches that still have a genuine need for product purchasing options. Some niches haven\u2019t been tapped into heavily, while other niches have product-based needs that your store could help with. However, it can be difficult to know where to just start looking for optimal dropshipping niche ideas. Where do you look? How do you look? What criteria should you use for finding good niches? To the beginner, these are daunting questions. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so intimidating: niche evaluation is really a specialized field of its own. You could spend months choosing the best niche, but that\u2019s not exactly practical for dropshipping. Luckily, there are tactics you can use to choose a great niche in a matter of weeks (or even days, though you shouldn\u2019t rush it). Basically, you have to determine if a niche is suitable based on the following: The level of competition The demand for physical niche products The long term forecast of niche popularity The best dropshipping niche would have low to medium competition and high demand. It would also stay popular indefinitely. Of course, niches like this don\u2019t exist, so you have to figure out how to balance these criteria. The right balance for you might not be right for another entrepreneur, so you have to think critically about which elements are most important to you. Here\u2019s a simple two-step process you can use to start your search for a niche. It revolves around the idea that some niches are better for physical products than others. Once you\u2019ve found those niches, you can ask other questions to help you narrow it down further. Step 1: Search for trending or low-Competition niches. \u00b6 Begin by doing a simple Google search for \u2018trending niches\u2019 or \u2018low-competition niches\u2019. You\u2019ll have to narrow your search a lot, but this is a basic start. You\u2019re just taking baby steps for now and getting a very big picture sense of the various dropshipping niche ideas out there. finding niche products Typically when you search for trending niches, you\u2019ll find lists of niche products that are currently popular or predicted to become popular in the coming months. These have a lot of potential, but they may also get crowded. Low-competition niches, by definition, won\u2019t be too crowded, but this could limit how much you can earn. Niches with super-low levels of competition will usually have smaller audiences, and that translates into a smaller customer base for your business. In addition, some niches won\u2019t be right for dropshipping, so you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re looking at product-based niches. (For example, explainer videos have surged in popularity, but an explainer video is not a physical product, so dropshipping is out of the question.) When you\u2019re looking at niches, you want to make sure they meet a few important criteria. You could do this later, but I feel it\u2019s best to filter your results early on. Here are some questions to ask: Is This a Product-Based Niche? \u00b6 First, it\u2019s essential to make sure the niche you\u2019re considering has a decent amount of physical products associated with it. Some niches, like explainer videos, have no product-based needs at all. Other niches do have product-based needs but not many. For example, niches that mostly deal with digital products, like cryptocurrency, aren\u2019t all that practical for dropshipping because of the low amount of physical products available. As you do more research, you\u2019ll see that certain niches are inherently more plentiful with products than others. For example, clothing is better than time management for dropshipping because it offers more product variety. The more niche products you can offer, the better. You don\u2019t want to sell everything under the sun, but you do want to have a good amount of variety. That\u2019s why a niche that has lots of products is great for dropshipping. It gives you a ton of room for growth and expansion. This can be tough because with a high amount of product variety, there\u2019s often a high level of competition. However, if you look outside of the most popular niches, you should be able to find some niches that aren\u2019t too competitive yet still have a good amount of product variety. Last but not least, make sure the products are easily accessible for both you and your customers. For example, custom made items are generally more difficult to dropship, and they won\u2019t give you the best profit margins. You also want to consider the fact that the more obscure niche products won\u2019t have a broad appeal. As a general rule, a product that appeals to a wide group of people within the niche is a good product to dropship. How Popular Is This Niche? \u00b6 Ideally, you\u2019re after a niche that\u2019s not too popular. You want to choose a niche that has sufficient interest and product demand to sustain a retail business. Often, you will have to compromise, and it\u2019s a matter of knowing how to compromise. When conducting niche research, if you can tell right away that a niche is incredibly popular, be warned that it may be difficult to break into. As a new dropshipper, you\u2019ll face the challenge of getting your brand seen, and it\u2019s much easier in a lower competition niche (even though bigger niches may be tempting and seem easy). low competition niche Image source The niche evaluation steps in this chapter will help you find a good niche that\u2019s not too empty or too crowded. And in Chapter 5, when you research products, you\u2019ll get an even more detailed idea of how popular your chosen niche is. Is This Niche Just the Result of a Passing Fad? \u00b6 Every year, there are several handfuls of trends that come and go in a matter of months (sometimes weeks). Businesses pop up left and right to capitalize on these trends, but when the trends die, so do the businesses. At the same time, a new trend could become the next big niche. Lately, niche products like drones, fidget spinners, and virtual reality gear have become hugely popular in a matter of months, and the dropshippers in these niches have scored big. However, there\u2019s always a risk involved with going with the coolest new niche, so it is usually safer to choose a niche that\u2019s been around for a while. If you find a niche that\u2019s relatively new, it might not be a good idea to pursue it, but you have to evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. As a rule of thumb, you should give preference to niches with established (or at least devoted) communities. Am I Too Passionate About This Niche? \u00b6 I know this seems like a weird question because usually passion is a good thing. But in this case, too much passion can actually be detrimental to your dropshipping career. Let\u2019s say you have a lifelong love of lava lamps. That passion is great, but it won\u2019t necessarily translate into sales. You can\u2019t build a dropshipping career on lava lamps because they\u2019re very niche and not big sellers. You can have all the passion in the world for lava lamps, but you can\u2019t magically turn them into a sustainable career. In addition, passion can often blind you to the harsh truths that come with operating a business. Maybe certain niche products aren\u2019t selling well but you want to keep it around anyway because you like it and believe it will do well. So while it seems like having lots of passion is good, it\u2019s usually ideal to have a fair amount of detachment from the niche products you choose. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t pick your favorite niche for dropshipping. If you\u2019re able to objectively evaluate your niche and if it looks like a good choice, go for it. Getting an outside view helps a lot with this decision. You need to step back from what you think of a niche and look at it through an entrepreneurial lens. You\u2019re going to have to make business decisions based on facts and figures, and you need to be able to do that easily without being too emotionally or personally invested. Can I Actually Add Value to This Niche? \u00b6 This is another question few dropshippers ask. Most people think that opening up a store is a form of adding value, but that\u2019s not always true. If you\u2019re opening a store that\u2019s basically a carbon copy of an existing store, you\u2019re not doing anything new or unique. You have very little to differentiate yourself from your competitors. adding value But the most problematic thing is that some entrepreneurs who start dropshipping businesses like this don\u2019t want to provide value. These are the get-rich-quick schemers who see dropshipping as a means to an end. Customers can see right through this, and it\u2019s also a poor attitude to have in general. It\u2019s easy to tell if a business is earnestly trying to provide value or just trying to make a quick buck. People are more likely to support businesses that give them value. By putting your customers first and emphasizing value, you\u2019ll be creating the best conditions for your business to grow. If you don\u2019t focus on value, you\u2019ll have a harder time selling. That\u2019s why you need to be honest with yourself here. Can you really add value to the niche you\u2019re considering? Can you offer something different to customers who have a bunch of retailers to choose from? One of the best ways to evaluate this is by looking at retailers who are already in the niche, and that\u2019s what the second step is all about. However, this is a question you should start thinking about now. If you feel like you can\u2019t take an interesting angle or do something differently, reconsider the niche (as painful as that may be). Rather revise your niche than choose one that won\u2019t work for you. Step 2: Search for existing retailers. \u00b6 Next, spend some time researching the retailers who are already established in the niche. For now, simple Google searches will suffice. Use various combinations and product keywords to see who\u2019s selling what, and pay attention to who the big players are (i.e., the retailers you see over and over again). This step really deserves an analytical approach if you want to get the most out of it. I recommend keeping a list of the retailers you find and making sure to record details like their name, website, and social handles. (A spreadsheet is great for this.) Don\u2019t just look at the most popular stores \u2013 search high and low, and look at everything that\u2019s out there. There may be smaller retailers who are becoming popular and doing something unique, and analyzing these stores is just as important as analyzing the big names in your niche. And don\u2019t be afraid to take extensive notes on what you see. Often it\u2019s the little things that matter, and scrutinizing details can help you understand why some retailers\u2019 strategies are so successful. Once you understand what they\u2019re doing, you can break it down and use the knowledge for yourself. Once you\u2019ve gotten a list of 5-10 retailers, take this opportunity to also look at each store\u2019s online presence. You don\u2019t need to do extensive research at this point. Just take a look at each retailer\u2019s site and social media accounts to get a rough idea of their strategies. See what kinds of content they post, how they engage customers, and when they mention their products. If you can\u2019t find many retailers, that could be a good or a bad sign. Low competition is great, but you still need to have a sizeable audience to buy your niche products. This means that if you barely find any retailers, you\u2019ll need to look at pages and online communities dedicated to the niche. Lots of activity is good, but low activity means this niche is probably a bad choice. It could also mean that this niche doesn\u2019t have a huge need for physical products. This step doesn\u2019t need to determine the niche you choose, but it should give you an idea of what you\u2019re dealing with. It will clue you into how popular the niche is and how much value you could give customers. Again, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a lot of time on this step. When you\u2019re finished, you should have a list of niches that are practical for dropshipping, along with the details of retailers who are already in those niches. Is It Better to Choose a Super Saturated or Super Unsaturated Niche? \u00b6 The perfect niche The perfect niche would have low competition but a large audience. In the real world, that rarely happens. The typical niche is moderately saturated, with a reasonable number of retailers and an audience that\u2019s not too big or too small. But what if you\u2019re stuck between choosing a super-saturated or a super-unsaturated niche? That\u2019s a tough decision. It\u2019s important to note that you probably won\u2019t have to choose between these two extremely different options. Most of the time, you\u2019ll find niches that aren\u2019t completely saturated or unsaturated. If those are your only choices, you might want to go back to the drawing board and consider other dropshipping niche ideas. It\u2019s hard to be profitable in a niche that has a huge amount of competition, but it\u2019s just as hard to be profitable in a niche that doesn\u2019t generate a lot of interest. Like I said, this won\u2019t happen often, but it\u2019s important to think about because it makes you calibrate your mindset. You shouldn\u2019t focus on making profit so much that you skimp on choosing the right niche. Entering a huge dropshipping niche seems like it\u2019s a good idea, but in reality, you can have a lot of trouble selling niche products when you have thousands and thousands of competitors. Is the Niche Sustainable? \u00b6 This is another major question you need to ask about any niche you\u2019re seriously considering for dropshipping. Whether you\u2019re dropshipping on the side or full-time, you need to think about how sustainable a niche will be for you. Even if you\u2019ve already determined the niche is not just a fad that will blow over in a matter of months, you still need to think about the future. Considering the long term can mean the difference between success and failure. Plenty of niche products seem ideal for dropshipping, but when you think about where those niches will be a year from now, you start to realize that they might not be so promising. Let\u2019s go back to the example of phone cases. While the phone case niche is extremely saturated, there will always be a need for phone cases. People aren\u2019t giving up their phones, and the amount of people with phones isn\u2019t decreasing. Most importantly, people will always want to personalize and decorate their phones. Thus, it\u2019s a sustainable niche. Now let\u2019s take another niche product with a very specific angle: eclipse-related products for the United States. When total solar eclipses happen, people go crazy with buying all kinds of gear related to the phenomenon. It seems like it\u2019d be a no-brainer to set up a dropshipping retailer for this. unique niche products However, total solar eclipses don\u2019t occur in the U.S. very often. Because of that, a dropshipping store that sells eclipse products would only get business during eclipse years. Most years, it would get zero sales, which means these niche products are a poor choice for a long-term dropshipping business. Finally, let\u2019s consider a third niche: clothing with catchphrases. This is a tough trend to forecast because some catchphrases stick around while others don\u2019t. (Think about the lasting \u201cKeep Calm and ____\u201d trend.) While you could strike gold with the right catchphrase, this idea isn\u2019t the best for a dropshipping store. The trend will eventually die out (even if it takes a couple of years), so if you\u2019re looking to do dropshipping long term, you\u2019d want to avoid those niche products. When thinking about sustainability, ask yourself what the lifespan of the niche is. Do you see this niche being as popular a year from now? What about five years? What do experts think? This can be a tough nut to crack, and sometimes there will be risk involved because it\u2019s impossible to predict the future of any given niche. Just be sure you\u2019re not pouring all your money into a fad that will be over a month or a year from now. Niche Evaluation in Action \u00b6 Now you know all of the strategies for selecting which niche to choose, but maybe you\u2019re a little confused about how it all comes together. So let\u2019s put all of this into practice by looking at an example. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re looking to set up your first dropshipping store, and you\u2019ve searched the Internet for some niches that are ripe for new businesses. You have a list of 4 niches: Travel products Custom T-shirts Coding Fidget spinners To narrow this list down to just one final choice, you can ask the questions listed in the 2-step process above. Here\u2019s how that might look. Question 1: Is this a product-based niche? \u00b6 The first step is to filter out the niches that don\u2019t have a large need for physical products. But even once you\u2019ve done that, you want to gauge how well physical products could perform in the remaining niches. Right off the bat, you can answer \u2018no\u2019 for coding. Coding has a few physical products associated with it, but for the most part it\u2019s a digital-based niche. So you could remove that from your list. The other three niches all have specific physical products associated with them, so they get a \u2018yes\u2019 for this question. Now onto part 2 of this question. Exactly how big of a need does each niche have for products? You could argue that all three have fairly large needs, so for now you can keep considering all of them. Question 2: How popular is the niche? \u00b6 Next, it\u2019s time to examine the popularity of each niche examine the popularity of each niche. Your answers here won\u2019t necessarily eliminate any niches from your list. Instead, this step is meant to give you a sense of what you\u2019re dealing with. The problem with this question is that niche products fluctuate in popularity from time to time, so there are no hard-and-fast answers to this. It\u2019s a question you have to answer for yourself. Conducting research on each niche is the best way to accurately analyze its current and future popularity. But for the sake of argument, I\u2019ll say that custom T-shirts and fidget spinners are very popular while travel products are moderately popular. Again, these terms are subjective, and I\u2019m using them just for this example. In actual practice, you\u2019ll want to have more specific data to compare. That means you have the biggest chance selling travel-related niche products, but it also doesn\u2019t eliminate the other two entirely. It\u2019s simply a warning sign that those niches (custom T-shirts and fidget spinners) may be too big to break into. Nothing is impossible; some niches are just easier than others for dropshipping. Question 3: Is this niche just the result of a passing fad? \u00b6 This is an easy one. For fidget spinners, you can quickly answer \u2018yes\u2019, so that one has to go. Those niche products are definitely part of a fad that won\u2019t carry on into the future. On the other hand, custom T-shirts and travel products are not fads, so they can stay. Question 4: Can I actually add value to this niche? \u00b6 This question will often decide whether you eliminate a niche or not. You have to put away your dreams of making it big and be brutally honest with yourself. Take any niche you\u2019re seriously considering and ask yourself if you can add tons of value with a new online store add tons of value with a new online store. Will you be able to fill a need that other merchants aren\u2019t filling? Will you be able to offer something new or different to prospective customers? Will you present or offer niche products that your competitors don\u2019t sell? This is a difficult question to answer, but in this example, the two niches left (custom T-shirts and travel products) are quite different in terms of market saturation. There\u2019s no question that there are far more custom T-shirt stores than there are travel products stores. It\u2019s also difficult to add value to a niche when it\u2019s so saturated, and you might find that\u2019s the case with custom T-shirts. You can get any kind of custom T-shirt you can imagine, so you can\u2019t really offer anything unique. However, it\u2019s possible that with excellent design options, you could very well offer something your competitors can\u2019t. t-shirt custom dropship Image source This question might take you a while to answer, and that\u2019s par for the course. You\u2019ll also need to think critically and honestly about your ability to add value in niches that are more saturated. Overall, in this example, travel products would be the best choice. Question 5: Is the niche sustainable? \u00b6 But wait! You\u2019re not done yet. You have one step left: make sure the niche is sustainable. There\u2019s only one niche left: travel products. Travel-related niche products are certainly something people will always need, and people aren\u2019t going to stop traveling anytime soon, so you can confidently say the niche is sustainable. Final Thoughts \u00b6 Before I conclude this chapter, I want to say a few words on the process of niche selection. I hope this example process has helped you see how to execute these strategies yourself. It won\u2019t always be as easy as this to choose a niche, so be prepared to dig in and do some research. It can be hard to tell if certain niche products are unsustainable or too popular. Trust me when I say that even if you put in a ton of work on this step, it will all pay off in the future. When you use this process, be thorough. Even if you narrow down your list to one niche early on, you still need to ask the rest of these questions. A good dropshipping niche will always pass this test. Of course, it could be that none of the niches you selected will work for you. That can be a hard pill to swallow because you\u2019ll have to start all over again, but it\u2019s much better than choosing the wrong niche. Finally, bear in mind that you may need to revisit this step. The next chapter discusses how to select niche products, which is another complex issue in itself. You may find that your ideal niche has a super-crowded product landscape, or that it hasn\u2019t been profitable for a long time. In those kinds of situations, you might want to go through the niche selection process all over again. This can seem like grunt work, but you have to push through it until you find a profitable, sustainable niche with a good variety of products. You\u2019ve Got a Dropshipping Niche! Now What? \u00b6 Congratulations! You\u2019ve completed one of the toughest steps in the journey! Next, you have to choose the products you\u2019re going to offer. Before you do so, I recommend taking some time to really familiarize yourself with your niche. If you already know it inside and out, great. If not, take 7-14 days to study your niche.

I know it\u2019s tempting to find the hottest new niche and spend an afternoon setting up a store. In fact, that\u2019s what a large number of dropshippers do. They see which niche products are exploding and blindly hop on the bandwagon. However, this is not a good method. You might achieve runaway success for a while, but after that ends, you\u2019ll probably watch your business fall apart. This happens to almost every entrepreneur who capitalizes on the latest craze. A business model like that simply isn\u2019t meant to last, and my goal is to help you create a sustainable dropshipping retail career. If you want to turn dropshipping into a steadily flowing stream of income, you\u2019ll need to choose your niche carefully. In fact, niche selection is one of the most important business decisions you\u2019ll ever make. It sets the stage for everything else to follow. Think about it. The niche you choose will influence: What products you offer How much you sell Which suppliers you work with What marketing strategies you use How successful your business will ultimately be It\u2019s a big decision, and it\u2019s not one to be taken lightly. Too often, dropshippers realize the niche they chose isn\u2019t working out, and they have to go back square one. That can be a colossal waste of time, money, and other important resources, especially if you\u2019ve been at it for a while. The more thought you put into selecting a niche, the sturdier your business will be. You won\u2019t doubt yourself a few months down the road. And that\u2019s what this chapter is all about: helping you find the best dropshipping niche for your business. I find that a lot of success with dropshipping comes from asking the right questions. So without further ado, let\u2019s look at the most important questions you need to ask yourself when selecting a niche.","title":"Choosing Your Niche"},{"location":"en/ch04/#how-to-evaluate-dropshipping-niche-ideas","text":"Choosing a niche can be confusing. There are millions of niches, so it\u2019s tricky to know which ones are viable. To make matters worse, many of those niches have established businesses you\u2019d be competing directly against. It\u2019s the million dollar question: how do you break into a profitable niche as a newbie? When you\u2019re thinking about this, it may seem like every niche is saturated, but that\u2019s not true. There are niches that still have a genuine need for product purchasing options. Some niches haven\u2019t been tapped into heavily, while other niches have product-based needs that your store could help with. However, it can be difficult to know where to just start looking for optimal dropshipping niche ideas. Where do you look? How do you look? What criteria should you use for finding good niches? To the beginner, these are daunting questions. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s so intimidating: niche evaluation is really a specialized field of its own. You could spend months choosing the best niche, but that\u2019s not exactly practical for dropshipping. Luckily, there are tactics you can use to choose a great niche in a matter of weeks (or even days, though you shouldn\u2019t rush it). Basically, you have to determine if a niche is suitable based on the following: The level of competition The demand for physical niche products The long term forecast of niche popularity The best dropshipping niche would have low to medium competition and high demand. It would also stay popular indefinitely. Of course, niches like this don\u2019t exist, so you have to figure out how to balance these criteria. The right balance for you might not be right for another entrepreneur, so you have to think critically about which elements are most important to you. Here\u2019s a simple two-step process you can use to start your search for a niche. It revolves around the idea that some niches are better for physical products than others. Once you\u2019ve found those niches, you can ask other questions to help you narrow it down further.","title":"How to Evaluate Dropshipping Niche Ideas"},{"location":"en/ch04/#step-1-search-for-trending-or-low-competition-niches","text":"Begin by doing a simple Google search for \u2018trending niches\u2019 or \u2018low-competition niches\u2019. You\u2019ll have to narrow your search a lot, but this is a basic start. You\u2019re just taking baby steps for now and getting a very big picture sense of the various dropshipping niche ideas out there. finding niche products Typically when you search for trending niches, you\u2019ll find lists of niche products that are currently popular or predicted to become popular in the coming months. These have a lot of potential, but they may also get crowded. Low-competition niches, by definition, won\u2019t be too crowded, but this could limit how much you can earn. Niches with super-low levels of competition will usually have smaller audiences, and that translates into a smaller customer base for your business. In addition, some niches won\u2019t be right for dropshipping, so you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re looking at product-based niches. (For example, explainer videos have surged in popularity, but an explainer video is not a physical product, so dropshipping is out of the question.) When you\u2019re looking at niches, you want to make sure they meet a few important criteria. You could do this later, but I feel it\u2019s best to filter your results early on. Here are some questions to ask:","title":"Step 1: Search for trending or low-Competition niches."},{"location":"en/ch04/#is-this-a-product-based-niche","text":"First, it\u2019s essential to make sure the niche you\u2019re considering has a decent amount of physical products associated with it. Some niches, like explainer videos, have no product-based needs at all. Other niches do have product-based needs but not many. For example, niches that mostly deal with digital products, like cryptocurrency, aren\u2019t all that practical for dropshipping because of the low amount of physical products available. As you do more research, you\u2019ll see that certain niches are inherently more plentiful with products than others. For example, clothing is better than time management for dropshipping because it offers more product variety. The more niche products you can offer, the better. You don\u2019t want to sell everything under the sun, but you do want to have a good amount of variety. That\u2019s why a niche that has lots of products is great for dropshipping. It gives you a ton of room for growth and expansion. This can be tough because with a high amount of product variety, there\u2019s often a high level of competition. However, if you look outside of the most popular niches, you should be able to find some niches that aren\u2019t too competitive yet still have a good amount of product variety. Last but not least, make sure the products are easily accessible for both you and your customers. For example, custom made items are generally more difficult to dropship, and they won\u2019t give you the best profit margins. You also want to consider the fact that the more obscure niche products won\u2019t have a broad appeal. As a general rule, a product that appeals to a wide group of people within the niche is a good product to dropship.","title":"Is This a Product-Based Niche?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#how-popular-is-this-niche","text":"Ideally, you\u2019re after a niche that\u2019s not too popular. You want to choose a niche that has sufficient interest and product demand to sustain a retail business. Often, you will have to compromise, and it\u2019s a matter of knowing how to compromise. When conducting niche research, if you can tell right away that a niche is incredibly popular, be warned that it may be difficult to break into. As a new dropshipper, you\u2019ll face the challenge of getting your brand seen, and it\u2019s much easier in a lower competition niche (even though bigger niches may be tempting and seem easy). low competition niche Image source The niche evaluation steps in this chapter will help you find a good niche that\u2019s not too empty or too crowded. And in Chapter 5, when you research products, you\u2019ll get an even more detailed idea of how popular your chosen niche is.","title":"How Popular Is This Niche?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#is-this-niche-just-the-result-of-a-passing-fad","text":"Every year, there are several handfuls of trends that come and go in a matter of months (sometimes weeks). Businesses pop up left and right to capitalize on these trends, but when the trends die, so do the businesses. At the same time, a new trend could become the next big niche. Lately, niche products like drones, fidget spinners, and virtual reality gear have become hugely popular in a matter of months, and the dropshippers in these niches have scored big. However, there\u2019s always a risk involved with going with the coolest new niche, so it is usually safer to choose a niche that\u2019s been around for a while. If you find a niche that\u2019s relatively new, it might not be a good idea to pursue it, but you have to evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. As a rule of thumb, you should give preference to niches with established (or at least devoted) communities.","title":"Is This Niche Just the Result of a Passing Fad?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#am-i-too-passionate-about-this-niche","text":"I know this seems like a weird question because usually passion is a good thing. But in this case, too much passion can actually be detrimental to your dropshipping career. Let\u2019s say you have a lifelong love of lava lamps. That passion is great, but it won\u2019t necessarily translate into sales. You can\u2019t build a dropshipping career on lava lamps because they\u2019re very niche and not big sellers. You can have all the passion in the world for lava lamps, but you can\u2019t magically turn them into a sustainable career. In addition, passion can often blind you to the harsh truths that come with operating a business. Maybe certain niche products aren\u2019t selling well but you want to keep it around anyway because you like it and believe it will do well. So while it seems like having lots of passion is good, it\u2019s usually ideal to have a fair amount of detachment from the niche products you choose. That\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t pick your favorite niche for dropshipping. If you\u2019re able to objectively evaluate your niche and if it looks like a good choice, go for it. Getting an outside view helps a lot with this decision. You need to step back from what you think of a niche and look at it through an entrepreneurial lens. You\u2019re going to have to make business decisions based on facts and figures, and you need to be able to do that easily without being too emotionally or personally invested.","title":"Am I Too Passionate About This Niche?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#can-i-actually-add-value-to-this-niche","text":"This is another question few dropshippers ask. Most people think that opening up a store is a form of adding value, but that\u2019s not always true. If you\u2019re opening a store that\u2019s basically a carbon copy of an existing store, you\u2019re not doing anything new or unique. You have very little to differentiate yourself from your competitors. adding value But the most problematic thing is that some entrepreneurs who start dropshipping businesses like this don\u2019t want to provide value. These are the get-rich-quick schemers who see dropshipping as a means to an end. Customers can see right through this, and it\u2019s also a poor attitude to have in general. It\u2019s easy to tell if a business is earnestly trying to provide value or just trying to make a quick buck. People are more likely to support businesses that give them value. By putting your customers first and emphasizing value, you\u2019ll be creating the best conditions for your business to grow. If you don\u2019t focus on value, you\u2019ll have a harder time selling. That\u2019s why you need to be honest with yourself here. Can you really add value to the niche you\u2019re considering? Can you offer something different to customers who have a bunch of retailers to choose from? One of the best ways to evaluate this is by looking at retailers who are already in the niche, and that\u2019s what the second step is all about. However, this is a question you should start thinking about now. If you feel like you can\u2019t take an interesting angle or do something differently, reconsider the niche (as painful as that may be). Rather revise your niche than choose one that won\u2019t work for you.","title":"Can I Actually Add Value to This Niche?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#step-2-search-for-existing-retailers","text":"Next, spend some time researching the retailers who are already established in the niche. For now, simple Google searches will suffice. Use various combinations and product keywords to see who\u2019s selling what, and pay attention to who the big players are (i.e., the retailers you see over and over again). This step really deserves an analytical approach if you want to get the most out of it. I recommend keeping a list of the retailers you find and making sure to record details like their name, website, and social handles. (A spreadsheet is great for this.) Don\u2019t just look at the most popular stores \u2013 search high and low, and look at everything that\u2019s out there. There may be smaller retailers who are becoming popular and doing something unique, and analyzing these stores is just as important as analyzing the big names in your niche. And don\u2019t be afraid to take extensive notes on what you see. Often it\u2019s the little things that matter, and scrutinizing details can help you understand why some retailers\u2019 strategies are so successful. Once you understand what they\u2019re doing, you can break it down and use the knowledge for yourself. Once you\u2019ve gotten a list of 5-10 retailers, take this opportunity to also look at each store\u2019s online presence. You don\u2019t need to do extensive research at this point. Just take a look at each retailer\u2019s site and social media accounts to get a rough idea of their strategies. See what kinds of content they post, how they engage customers, and when they mention their products. If you can\u2019t find many retailers, that could be a good or a bad sign. Low competition is great, but you still need to have a sizeable audience to buy your niche products. This means that if you barely find any retailers, you\u2019ll need to look at pages and online communities dedicated to the niche. Lots of activity is good, but low activity means this niche is probably a bad choice. It could also mean that this niche doesn\u2019t have a huge need for physical products. This step doesn\u2019t need to determine the niche you choose, but it should give you an idea of what you\u2019re dealing with. It will clue you into how popular the niche is and how much value you could give customers. Again, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a lot of time on this step. When you\u2019re finished, you should have a list of niches that are practical for dropshipping, along with the details of retailers who are already in those niches.","title":"Step 2: Search for existing retailers."},{"location":"en/ch04/#is-it-better-to-choose-a-super-saturated-or-super-unsaturated-niche","text":"The perfect niche The perfect niche would have low competition but a large audience. In the real world, that rarely happens. The typical niche is moderately saturated, with a reasonable number of retailers and an audience that\u2019s not too big or too small. But what if you\u2019re stuck between choosing a super-saturated or a super-unsaturated niche? That\u2019s a tough decision. It\u2019s important to note that you probably won\u2019t have to choose between these two extremely different options. Most of the time, you\u2019ll find niches that aren\u2019t completely saturated or unsaturated. If those are your only choices, you might want to go back to the drawing board and consider other dropshipping niche ideas. It\u2019s hard to be profitable in a niche that has a huge amount of competition, but it\u2019s just as hard to be profitable in a niche that doesn\u2019t generate a lot of interest. Like I said, this won\u2019t happen often, but it\u2019s important to think about because it makes you calibrate your mindset. You shouldn\u2019t focus on making profit so much that you skimp on choosing the right niche. Entering a huge dropshipping niche seems like it\u2019s a good idea, but in reality, you can have a lot of trouble selling niche products when you have thousands and thousands of competitors.","title":"Is It Better to Choose a Super Saturated or Super Unsaturated Niche?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#is-the-niche-sustainable","text":"This is another major question you need to ask about any niche you\u2019re seriously considering for dropshipping. Whether you\u2019re dropshipping on the side or full-time, you need to think about how sustainable a niche will be for you. Even if you\u2019ve already determined the niche is not just a fad that will blow over in a matter of months, you still need to think about the future. Considering the long term can mean the difference between success and failure. Plenty of niche products seem ideal for dropshipping, but when you think about where those niches will be a year from now, you start to realize that they might not be so promising. Let\u2019s go back to the example of phone cases. While the phone case niche is extremely saturated, there will always be a need for phone cases. People aren\u2019t giving up their phones, and the amount of people with phones isn\u2019t decreasing. Most importantly, people will always want to personalize and decorate their phones. Thus, it\u2019s a sustainable niche. Now let\u2019s take another niche product with a very specific angle: eclipse-related products for the United States. When total solar eclipses happen, people go crazy with buying all kinds of gear related to the phenomenon. It seems like it\u2019d be a no-brainer to set up a dropshipping retailer for this. unique niche products However, total solar eclipses don\u2019t occur in the U.S. very often. Because of that, a dropshipping store that sells eclipse products would only get business during eclipse years. Most years, it would get zero sales, which means these niche products are a poor choice for a long-term dropshipping business. Finally, let\u2019s consider a third niche: clothing with catchphrases. This is a tough trend to forecast because some catchphrases stick around while others don\u2019t. (Think about the lasting \u201cKeep Calm and ____\u201d trend.) While you could strike gold with the right catchphrase, this idea isn\u2019t the best for a dropshipping store. The trend will eventually die out (even if it takes a couple of years), so if you\u2019re looking to do dropshipping long term, you\u2019d want to avoid those niche products. When thinking about sustainability, ask yourself what the lifespan of the niche is. Do you see this niche being as popular a year from now? What about five years? What do experts think? This can be a tough nut to crack, and sometimes there will be risk involved because it\u2019s impossible to predict the future of any given niche. Just be sure you\u2019re not pouring all your money into a fad that will be over a month or a year from now.","title":"Is the Niche Sustainable?"},{"location":"en/ch04/#niche-evaluation-in-action","text":"Now you know all of the strategies for selecting which niche to choose, but maybe you\u2019re a little confused about how it all comes together.

But for the sake of argument, I\u2019ll say that custom T-shirts and fidget spinners are very popular while travel products are moderately popular.

In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn the basics of selling products online and how to find the best dropshipping products for your niche. The ability to conduct valuable product research product research and analyze trend data will serve you well, and you can even apply these skills to other areas like SEO. Let\u2019s get started by going over the basics. The Basics of Selling Products Online \u00b6 There are some basic truths of products that apply to dropshipping products, and you have to be aware of these if you want to succeed. Specifically, there are certain ways to make money with products, and you have to be using at least one (preferably more) of these strategies: Gain rights to exclusive distribution or pricing . Since you can\u2019t manufacture your own dropshipping products, the next best thing is to acquire exclusive access to product distribution product distribution or pricing. If you\u2019re the only retailer offering a product (or a special low price for that product), it\u2019ll be easy to generate sales because you\u2019ll have a monopoly on that product or price point. This isn\u2019t always easy to accomplish, but it can be very lucrative if you can manage it. Sell at lower prices than your competitors . This is the approach most dropshippers take: undercut competition by dropshipping products at rock-bottom prices. But this is a business model that will eventually fail. At some point, you won\u2019t be able to sell at such low prices without taking a loss. And just think about having to compete with other retailers, especially giants like Amazon. It\u2019s just not practical, and I don\u2019t recommend doing this. Add value . I\u2019ve already stressed this, but it bears repeating. Many dropshippers don\u2019t even think to add value, which makes this one of the best strategies to use. You might add value with buyers\u2019 guides, professional quality product images, or how-to videos. Whatever you do, it\u2019s important that you can offer some sort of value in addition to dropshipping products that your customers want. When it comes to dropshipping products, adding value is the surest way to succeed. It\u2019s also the easiest strategy in many respects. Even if you know how you\u2019re going to add value to your store, you still need to think about things like pricing, marketing, product availability, product demand, and competition. Each of these areas are complex and need to be thoroughly addressed before you move on. Pricing \u00b6 This is a big one. Obviously pricing is something you must consider carefully if you want to sell products online, but many entrepreneurs don\u2019t give it the attention it deserves. When it comes to dropshipping products, you need to think about how you\u2019re going to price your items and how you can price your items. price planning dropshipping Image source That\u2019s because sometimes there are limits on how you can price your items. Many manufacturers set a minimum advertised price (MAP). If a product has a MAP, it means you, as a reseller, have to price the item at or above that price. This is a great thing because it prevents retailers from dropshipping products at super-low prices and starting pricing wars. It also levels the playing field among dropshippers, which means you don\u2019t have to lower your prices just to stand out. On the flip side, MAPs limit the amount of profit you can make, but this is a small compromise for the benefits that MAPs bring. Some manufacturers don\u2019t set MAPs for their items, which makes selling a bit trickier. You could find yourself losing sales because some other store is selling the same product for less. At the same time, lowering your prices would slash your margins even more, so it\u2019s pretty much a lose-lose situation. Overall, products with MAPs are better for your bottom line. You also want to think about the price range for the items you\u2019ll offer. Although being the cheapest retailer is a bad strategy, you do want to be able to price competitively, and you\u2019ll want to offer items that are accessible to customers. This is especially true when it comes to dropshipping products that are particularly expensive. Deciding to offer pricey items can present additional issues. If your items are on the pricier side ($500 and up), potential buyers will often want to talk to a sales representative to make sure your store is legitimate and that the product is right for them. So you\u2019ll have to budget for customer support so you can answer customers\u2019 questions and give them peace of mind. That level of customer support isn\u2019t always practical if you\u2019re a solopreneur bootstrapping everything with just a laptop. That\u2019s why the range of $100 to $200 (give or take $50 or so) is often considered the sweet spot for dropshipping products. You can make a solid profit and offer appealing prices to your customers without having to spend a pretty penny on customer support solutions. Marketing \u00b6 When it comes to dropshipping, marketing is very important. Even if you\u2019re not a marketing veteran, this is still something to spend some time with. You don\u2019t have to create super-detailed marketing strategies at this point, but you should have a general idea of how you\u2019re going to market your products. What channels could you use for marketing? What are other retailers doing? Are there many ways to market the dropshipping products in your niche, or are you limited? marketing dropship products Image source You can take a page from your competitors\u2019 books by seeing what kinds of marketing strategies they use seeing what kinds of marketing strategies they use and then analyzing which ones could work for you. You may be surprised at how easy it is to pick out useful strategies and techniques from other retailers. If you\u2019re new to marketing, check out this blog post this blog post that features 13 actionable strategies even a beginner can understand. When you\u2019re new to dropshipping, marketing is especially important because it\u2019s how you\u2019ll get people to your store. If you don\u2019t market your dropshipping products, you won\u2019t get any traffic. Even if you\u2019re using solutions like Shopify, Amazon, or eBay, you still need to leverage the power of marketing. While it\u2019s tempting to focus exclusively on social media marketing social media marketing, dropshipping businesses also benefit from other types of marketing. Can you set up an email marketing strategy around your store? What about advertisements? SEO SEO? Moreover, how are you planning to generate traffic and acquire customers? This stuff can get a little dry, but it\u2019s best to think about all of this now and not months from now when it\u2019s too late. Being proactive about marketing will help you hit the ground running when your store launches. Product Availability \u00b6 Availability is actually a pretty big factor in deciding which products to offer. When it comes to dropshipping products, it\u2019s important not to choose items which are too easily available. What do I mean by that? Well, why do most people buy items online? Because they can\u2019t get those items anywhere else. If you\u2019re dropshipping products that are only available online, you\u2019re going to optimize your store to get the most possible sales. On the other hand, if you\u2019re dropshipping products that are widely available, people have little incentive to buy from your store. This is especially true if customers can get something from a nearby store. This is the idea of scarcity in action, and it\u2019s important for driving sales. For example, if a customer needs products like paper towels or hand soap, they\u2019ll likely head down to their local big box store. But if they\u2019re looking for a good deal on, say, a high-capacity SD card or a custom phone case, they\u2019ll probably look online instead. This basically boils down to convenience; if it\u2019s more convenient for customers to order online, they will. When you sell products online, offering items like USB chargers or cutlery isn\u2019t always profitable. These are items you can easily obtain at most brick-and-mortar stores, so it\u2019s more convenient to purchase them in real life instead of online. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t sell any items that are easily available, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t rely only on such products. Product Demand \u00b6 If a product doesn\u2019t have sufficient demand, it might be a dud. Demand is a basic rule of economics basic rule of economics, but it\u2019s even more important when it comes to dropshipping products. Basically, demand is even more important for dropshipping than it is for other forms of online retail. product demand Image source In a niche market, there\u2019s more room to work with dropshipping products that have less demand. Think about action figures of characters from movies. That\u2019s an incredibly niche market, and in the large scheme of things there\u2019s a low level of demand, but the prices offset that low demand. If you\u2019re a hobbyist or collector who\u2019s not too interested in dropshipping, this isn\u2019t a problem. However, if you want a sustainable business, the best dropshipping products are those that are in moderately high to very high demand. Selling action figures isn\u2019t going to pay the bills consistently, even though it may pay well. You want items that have steady levels of demand. Later on in this chapter, I\u2019ll show you how to gauge demand by using various online tools and resources. When it\u2019s time to seek out potential products potential products for your store, you\u2019ll have to know these crucial skills. Competition \u00b6 If you want to sell products online, you need to stand out from the other stores that are just like yours. You have to study your competitors and discover where their weaknesses lie. The goal is to essentially one-up them by doing things that they\u2019re not doing. Researching your competition is a huge part of understanding how your niche\u2019s product landscape looks and how you can break in. analyzing competition Image source When I say study, I mean it. I\u2019m talking deep analysis of what your competitors sell, how they market themselves, what their websites look like, and so much more. Like marketing and product research, competitor analysis is ongoing competitor analysis is ongoing. As your rivals change their strategies and offer different dropshipping products, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye out because these actions could signify changes in trends. All of this makes up the basics of selling products online. I\u2019m going to get even more in depth in this chapter because dropshipping requires you to approach selling in a very targeted manner. Finding High-Demand Products \u00b6 As I mentioned earlier, demand is central to building a great dropshipping business. In fact, demand is a big reason why dropshipping can be so lucrative. Selling low-demand products is a dead end, so you want to ensure that you find products that have a significant level of demand. But how do you do this? You can evaluate demand by using online tools and by researching retailers within your niche. Both of these methods are invaluable for scouting the best dropshipping products with huge profit potential profit potential, and you\u2019ll always be able to use these techniques once you get them down. First, let\u2019s go over some of the best online tools for product selection. Google Keyword Planner \u00b6 When it comes to finding the best dropshipping products for your niche, conducting keyword research is an excellent method conducting keyword research is an excellent method. Keywords will reveal which products are being searched for. While you can\u2019t always tell if these products are selling, typically a high search volume means a product is performing well. Now you might not know anything about keyword research. That\u2019s okay! You don\u2019t need any prior knowledge to start searching like a pro. It\u2019s all in the tools you use, and the ones I\u2019ve gathered here are some of the best. I\u2019ll start with Google Keyword Planner Google Keyword Planner. There\u2019s a reason Keyword Planner is one of the most used keyword tools in the world. It\u2019s perhaps the most accessible keyword resource on the internet (and it\u2019s Google). It\u2019s also free, although you have to have an active ad campaign to use the planner. The downsides? The data is fairly general and not too comprehensive. You\u2019ll want to supplement the results you get with results from other tools (which is why I\u2019m talking about multiple tools here). That said, Keyword Planner is an excellent start, and it\u2019s definitely a tool you should use regularly. First, head to https://adwords.google.com https://adwords.google.com and make sure you\u2019re logged into the right account. Next, make sure you have an active ad campaign. You\u2019ll be able to see this in your AdWords dashboard. A campaign (or multiple campaigns) should appear in this section of the page: Google keyword planner find niche If you don\u2019t see any campaigns listed here, you\u2019ll need to create one by hitting the \u2018+ AD GROUP\u2019 button and filling out the next few pages. Once you have a campaign set up, head to the menu at the top of the screen. Click on \u2018Tools\u2019 and then \u2018Keyword Planner\u2019. how to find dropshipping niche with AdWords keyword planner You should see this screen: Get niche ideas with google adwords The Simple Way to Research Keywords If you want to take a quick look at search volume, or how much certain terms are being searched, click on \u2018Get search volume data and trends\u2019. research keywords AdWords Next, enter the search terms you want to look up. If you have a lot of keywords, you can upload a CSV, TSV, or text file, and the keyword tool will do all of the heavy lifting for you. find new keywords You can also target certain locations, choose to include Google\u2019s search partners, and specify a date range. (As for that last option called \u2018Negative keywords\u2019, I\u2019ll look at that later on in this chapter.) what are negative keywords When you\u2019re finished modifying the settings, hit \u2018Get search volume\u2019. Here\u2019s our example result: search volume dropshipping keywords This can look complex if you\u2019re not used to it, so here\u2019s how you should read this page. Let\u2019s focus just on the chart at the bottom. keywords ideas dropship The keywords you searched are on the far left side under the category \u2018Keyword (by relevance)\u2019. The Avg. monthly searches displays the monthly search volume for that keyword. To the right, the Competition category gives you an idea of how competitive each keyword is. These two categories work in tandem to provide you with a big picture view of every keyword. In this example, \u2018water bottle\u2019 has a monthly search volume of 100,000 to 1,000,000, while both \u2018insulated water bottle\u2019 and \u2018smart water bottle\u2019 are in the 10,000 to 100,000 range. Now, these are huge ranges, which can present a problem when you\u2019re trying to figure out which dropshipping products are being searched. There\u2019s a big difference between a product that gets 10,000 searches a month and another product that gets ten times that. That\u2019s why this is the simple way. This can give you a rough idea of how popular certain dropshipping products are, but to get the most specific information, you\u2019ll want to use the in-depth way of looking at keywords using Google\u2019s tool. The In-Depth Way to Research Keywords The in-depth method starts off the same way as the simple method. Head to your AdWords home page. Click on Tools and then Keyword Planner. Next, choose \u2018Enter or upload a list of keywords to get forecasts\u2019. advanced way to do keyword research This next step is almost identical to the simple way: enter your keywords and modify the fields as you want to. You can also choose languages here if you need to. When you\u2019re done, click \u2018Get forecasts\u2019. For this method, you\u2019ll need to enter a bid. If you already used the simple way, you can use one of the suggested bids here. keyword planner suggested bids Next, click the Keyword tab located right above the graph. Scroll down, and you\u2019ll see a chart that looks like this: google adwords keyword results Here you\u2019ll see much more detailed information about the search terms. You can see how many clicks the terms are receiving, their click-through rates (CTRs), average cost-per-click (CPC), and more. This is invaluable information that gives you more precise insight into the keywords you\u2019re researching. You can also adjust all of the parameters, including bid amount, date range, and locations. I know this seems like a lot, but the whole procedure is a lot faster than you might think. In time, you\u2019ll be able to crush tons of keyword searches in just a few minutes. This is a great method of getting detailed keyword results without having to study SEO for months. Get Long-Tail Keyword Ideas Another handy use of Keyword Planner generating long-tail keywords is generating long-tail keywords. Long-tail keywords are super-specific variations on keywords that usually make up most of a site\u2019s search volume. For example, if \u2018water bottle\u2019 is your focus keyword, some long-tails might be \u2018best water bottle for camping\u2019 and \u2018reusable water bottles\u2019. They\u2019re closely related to (and often include) the focus keyword. Most people will be using long-tails to search. Finding long-tails will help you find other potential dropshipping products that could be smash hits for your store. Here\u2019s how to do it using Keyword Planner. In AdWords, navigate to Tools > Keyword Planner . Select \u2018Search for new keywords using a phrase, website or category\u2019. long tail keyword ideas On the next page, enter a focus keyword in the box that says \u2018Your product or service\u2019. Fill out the rest of the forms as well. how to find long tail keywords Pay special attention to the \u2018Customize your search\u2019 section in the lower right hand corner. You can get super precise with your search here. keyword filters AdWords When you\u2019re finished filling everything out, click \u2018Get ideas\u2019. Scroll down a little bit on the next page, and you\u2019ll see a chart that looks like this: keyword results Google PPC These are all keywords that Google found based on the focus keyword you entered. You can see the average monthly search volume, competition level, and suggested bid. Even better, you can take these keywords and run them through the in-depth method mentioned above. This will let you analyze just how popular various products are. One last tip: If you set up a dummy campaign to use Keyword Planner, make sure you go back in and remove it. All in all, Google Keyword Planner is a fairly formidable tool for finding potential dropshipping products if you use it the right way. It arms you with some basic figures that you can use to start understanding which products are successful and which ones are dwindling in popularity. Google Trends \u00b6 Trends is another free Google tool that can be very helpful for selecting products. It especially comes in handy for taking the product ideas you\u2019ve found through Keyword Planner and more thoroughly analyzing them. Head over to https://trends.google.com https://trends.google.com and enter a search term in the box. When you search, you\u2019ll see a few options in a dropdown menu. Start by choosing \u2018search term\u2019. The next page will give you results based on your search term. There\u2019s a lot to take in here, so let\u2019s go over the most useful elements. First, you\u2019ll see a graph called Interest over time . Google trends dropshipping niche This is a super-useful visual of search volume over a time period that you can specify. You can also change the location, date range, category, and search type. This graph can help you understand if your products are seasonal or not. Many products spike in popularity during a certain time of year, and if any products you\u2019re considering do so, you\u2019ll want to know in advance. Check out the bump in this graph: Google trends identify niches for dropshipping This means that most people buy apple butter during September and October. During the rest of the year, apple butter purchases stay at a steady rate. This is definitely a seasonal product. Next on this page, you can see Interest by region. This is helpful for understanding where you might be getting the bulk of your orders from, and this can even give you a clue how often you\u2019ll have to use international shipping. At the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll see two sections called Related topics and related queries. Here you can get even more ideas for dropshipping products! These sections basically give you long-tail topics and search terms that you can look into. (They\u2019re also useful for SEO and marketing.) Finally, don\u2019t overlook the Compare feature all the way at the top. It lets you compare two or more search terms. It\u2019s extremely convenient for deep analysis. top selling dropshipping products Overall, Trends gives you a different perspective. While its comparative features are noteworthy, there\u2019s a lot to love about this free tool. SEMrush \u00b6 Want even more data? Comfortable with upping your SEO game? Then have a look at SEMrush. It\u2019s a much more comprehensive keyword tool that almost every professional SEO has used at one point or another. It can give you incredibly specific information about keywords, so you can grab keywords from Keyword Planner and enter them into SEMrush to get all the details. It\u2019s nothing short of an SEO powerhouse. The only caveat: You can only conduct 10 searches per day. You also only get 10 results for each category. This can be limiting if you want a super-thorough analysis. I still recommend SEMrush for its sheer power and usefulness. A paid plan will help you get the most out of the software, but realistically, the free plan will work for more dropshippers just starting out. Unless you have extra money burning a hole in your pocket, go with the free plan to start with. Head to SEMrush.com SEMrush.com and enter a keyword into the main search bar in the middle of the page and click \u2018Start Now\u2019. how to use SEMRush You\u2019ll see an analytics page that looks like this: SEMrush analytics page Here you can see four important headings: Organic Search, Paid Search, CPC Distribution, and Trend. Organic Search will show you the search volume (i.e., the average monthly searches for that keyword) for search that happens organically. This means that the company didn\u2019t spend money to bring in those searches. This category is key because it will reflect how many people are naturally using the keyword without the influence of any ads or campaigns. Paid Search is also important since it will give you the average CPC (cost per click) for the keyword. This amount represents how much you\u2019ll pay on average for someone to click on your ad. This isn\u2019t an exact number, but it will give you a sense of how much you\u2019re looking at spending. Wondering what CPC Distribution is? CPC distribution represents how expensive it is to bid on a particular keyword across the different PPC platforms. Clicking on a bar will give you more data. Finally, the Trend section represents the level of competition for that keyword. A score of 1 is the highest level of competition, while 0 means it has virtually no competition. Note that the Trend section only analyzes paid search, although SEMrush says it can reflect organic search as well. Scroll down on this page, and you\u2019ll see another section with two sections labeled Phrase Match Keywords and Related Keywords. SEMrush related and phase match keywords The Phrase Match Keywords include your target keyword in them. As you can see, the example target keyword I initially entered was \u2018travel water bottles\u2019, and the Phrase Match Keywords include \u2018best travel water bottle\u2019 and \u2018filter water bottle for travel\u2019. The Related Keywords section shows you keywords that are similar to your target keyword but do not necessarily include it. Some of these may be close, like \u2018best water bottles for travel\u2019. Both of these sections are great for generating long-tail keyword ideas, and you can see the volume and CPC as well. As a nice bonus, if you click on the little blue icons under the SERP heading, you\u2019ll open up a Google search for that keyword. This gives you a nice visual of what the search page looks like for a given keyword. Scroll some more, and you\u2019ll see another really helpful section titled Organic Search Results. organic search results SEMrush This is really useful because it shows you the top 100 organic results for that keyword. As I said earlier, organic traffic is essential to look at because it reflects customer interest in a product. This section will filter out all of the paid ad placements you see on Google search pages, so you see only the top organic results. There\u2019s one more part of the SEMrush analytics page that is particularly useful in a dropshipping context. If you look to the right of the Organic Search Results section, you\u2019ll see a bunch of data about ads: SEMrush competitor ad analysis Whereas Organic Search Results focused only on non-paid search, this section looks at paid search. Ads Copies will show you a few examples of ad copy for some of the top paid search ads. Here you can see four ads taken straight from the Google page, and you can conveniently see what copy they\u2019ve used. This is great for getting intel on your competition, and while it\u2019s no match for all-out competitive analysis, it\u2019s certainly a handy reference point that gives you a quick overview. It can also give you some ideas for some ad copy for your own products! Right below, you can see the Product Ads Copies category that displays pictorial ads for a couple of products. This section looks simple, and it might not seem like you can get a lot from it, but I\u2019ll break this down and show you how valuable this can be. First, you can see the title of the product. At first glance, this seems plain, but look deeper and you\u2019ll discover that you can take another peek into your competitors\u2019 SEO playbooks. That\u2019s because every product title is optimized for SEO, often containing keywords that are performing well in that niche. In this case, notice how both of these products contain the word \u2018collapsible\u2019. This suggests that \u2018collapsible travel water bottle\u2019 and other variants are doing well. If you were selling water bottles, you might want to look into offering collapsible bottles on your store and using those keywords. So you not only get a keyword idea but also a product idea, all from a few words. Second, these ad snippets display the price and the site selling them. This is another miniature form of competitive analysis. You can see who some of your competitors are and how they\u2019re pricing their products. Again, this information will only give you a rough guideline, but it\u2019s a convenient snapshot that you should look at whenever you\u2019re using SEMrush. The last section on this page is the Ads History category. ads history SEMrush This shows how actively websites were bidding on keywords. If you click on a bar, you\u2019ll see more information about which sites were bidding and how much they were bidding. I recommend using the Ads History graph to complement the knowledge you gained from Google Trends. SEMrush uses different databases than Google Trends, and it\u2019s always helpful to get data from a wide range of different sources. Learning to digest the SEMrush results page can be a little intimidating at first, so if you need some help, I suggest consulting this page from the SEMrush Knowledge Base this page from the SEMrush Knowledge Base. In addition, there are several Knowledge Base articles available that will familiarize you with the tool in no time. Competitors\u2019 Sites \u00b6 Before you analyze your competitors, you can use their sites to get even more information on product trends. You\u2019ve probably guessed it by now, but there\u2019s a targeted approach to this technique that produces the best results. Have your list of potential dropshipping products handy. Visit several (7-10) retailers\u2019 sites and take a look at their top products. Usually, there will be a dropdown box on the store page that will allow you to sort products so that best selling items show first. SEMrush competitor discovery This will rearrange the product page so that the best selling items are listed first. In other words, the absolute best seller will be the first result and so on. Keep in mind that sorting this way will show you the best-selling products of all time. It won\u2019t show you the items that have sold the most over the last month or year. It\u2019s not the most helpful way to search for products, but it\u2019s still worthwhile. You might also see some stores highlighting products or marking them as \u2018top sellers\u2019. top sellers semrush These are also products to pay attention to and record on a list. This typically means the products are currently trending, and they\u2019ll likely change over time. This is good to remember because if you notice a certain product that stays in a top seller category, it may mean that item sells consistently well. Gather this data from as many stores as possible, and organize it all on a spreadsheet for easy access. I recommend using separate spreadsheets (or at least separate categories) for all of the keywords and data you get from each online tool. This way, you can continuously compile data from each tool and keep it separate for easy reference. That\u2019s going to wrap up the keyword research section of this chapter. Now I\u2019ll show you how to analyze your competitors so you know what you\u2019re up against. Fair warning \u2013 if you\u2019re not too familiar with SEO, you\u2019ll need to spend a little time learning some basic concepts and terms, but it\u2019s easy for anyone to tackle. Analyse Your Competitors \u00b6 Once you have some dropshipping products selected, you\u2019ll need to scope out your competitors. This serves a twofold purpose: 1) It allows you to pinpoint your top competitors, which means you can start thinking about how you can get sales instead of them. 2) It gives you a practical understanding of which products are selling the best. Getting lots of keywords is great, but sizing up your competition is just as necessary. Since you\u2019re brand new to your niche, you\u2019ll be learning a lot from your competitors, and you can also analyze and then implement some of their techniques for areas like marketing and SEO. Thankfully, you can easily conduct competitive analysis using little more than Google. This is because Google\u2019s rankings are more or less indicative of how popular different retailers are. The higher up a site is on the SERPs, the more powerful it is, so retailers with high SERPs SERP positions are typically leaders in their niches. Because Google is set up like this, you can get a surface level view of your competition by simply Googling a product name and seeing which retailers come up. This won\u2019t give you exact statistics, so you need to use some additional tools to get the real juicy data. Moz Open Site Explorer \u00b6 Moz is one of the biggest names in SEO, and its Open Site Explorer tool is one of the best free SEO tools available. Often abbreviated to OSE, this is a link analysis tool that gives you a ton of information about a website. You can see how popular the website is, how much traffic it gets, and how many backlinks it has. (You can even get details on where those backlinks come from!) It\u2019s unparalleled for understanding how influential your competitors are. To take full advantage of all that OSE has to offer, you first have to understand a few terms and concepts. You don\u2019t have to be a trained SEO to get a good grasp of this, so don\u2019t fret if you don\u2019t have much experience. The main concepts are Domain Authority, Page Authority, and link structure. The best way to show you what all of these are is to see them in action. First, go to https://moz.com/researchtools/ose https://moz.com/researchtools/ose. Enter a URL into the search bar in the middle of the page and click \u2018Search\u2019. You\u2019ll see a results page that looks like this: Moz site explorer dropship To start off, look at just the category titled Authority. moz page authority There are three important metrics here: Domain Authority, Page Authority, and Spam Score. Domain Authority (DA) is a metric that Moz developed to display how well a domain will rank in search engines. 100 is the best possible DA score. Basically, the higher a site\u2019s DA score, the more likely a site is to rank well. If your site has a DA of 90, you can usually expect to rank on page 1. On the other hand, if your site has a DA of 25, it probably won\u2019t rank too well. DA is best for considering the general impact of a site. A high DA means that the site gets a high amount of traffic to its homepage and most of its other pages. That\u2019s why sites with higher DA scores will usually be your top competitors. Keep in mind that DA is not the final word on how a site will rank. It\u2019s simply a benchmark. You also don\u2019t need a high DA to rank on page 1 of the SERPs. Specific pages may rank better than the overall site they belong to, which brings me to the next metric\u2026 Page Authority (PA) is nearly identical to Domain Authority, except it analyzes the ranking strength of individual pages. This allows you to predict how well certain pages on your site (or on your competitors\u2019 sites) will rank. PA is useful for understanding the impact of a certain product page. When you enter in a specific URL, you\u2019ll want to look at the PA score to see how powerful that page is. It\u2019s good to check the PA scores of best selling product pages and compare those to the overall DA of the site. If both are high, that means the site gets a lot of traffic and probably sells a lot. If PA is high but DA is low, the site doesn\u2019t get a lot of traffic but likely sells certain items more than others. Finally, Spam Score checks to make sure a site is legitimate. Moz can tell when a site is set up for spam purposes, and that\u2019s where this signal comes in. 0 is where you want to be. To recap everything so far: High DA and PA scores are good, while a low spam score is ideal. Together, these three metrics will give you an idea of how well a site will rank. Now let\u2019s move on to the section called Page Link Metrics. page link metrics moz The Just-Discovered section can indicate how popular a site or page has become in the last 60 days. If you see a high number here, it means the site has gained a lot of backlinks in the last couple of months. The Established Links section is even more valuable. It shows you how many root domains and total links there are. The number of root domains shows you how many unique domains have linked to the site, while total links include any and all links, not just root domains. So if fakewebsite.com linked to your site twice, it would count as one root domain and two total links (since it\u2019s the same domain linking multiple times). A site with a high number of root domains will usually rank very well for several terms. This is generally the more important metric of the two. Why? Because Google prefers sites with lots of unique root domains and will rank them higher than sites with fewer root domain links. With that said, the number of total links can also help gauge how impactful a site is, since a high number of total links means the site has probably gotten multiple links from the same sites. This number also reflects the site\u2019s total reach and influence. At the bottom, you can see the specific inbound links (i.e., links pointing to the specific site or page). You can also filter results in case you want to see specific link types, which can be useful. moz inbound links There are a couple of reasons you might want to find out who is linking to your competitors. First, it shows you which sites you might be able to get backlinks from. Maybe you\u2019ll find some sites that feature dropshipping products or use affiliate programs to connect with retailers. Later on, when you\u2019re building an SEO strategy of your own, this information is nice to have. Second, you can personally check the credibility and quality of each backlink. For example, a site might get a ton of links but they could all come from shady sites. On the other hand, if popular sites are linking, then you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the competitor you\u2019re researching. There\u2019s one more item of note on this page: the Compare Link Metrics option. This is located in the menu on the left hand side: compare link metrics moz This feature allows you to compare multiple sites and see how their metrics stack up. For competitive analysis, this is a goldmine. You can pit your site directly against your competitors\u2019 or even compare multiple competitors against each other. Simply click \u2018Add URL\u2019, enter the address, and you\u2019ll get a neat chart with all the important metrics listed. moz page specific metrics Don\u2019t overlook this feature. It\u2019s one of my favorites for comparing competitors and seeing how my site is doing. All in all, OSE is a stellar resource, and it\u2019ll quickly become a part of your daily business routine. PageRank Checkers \u00b6 PageRank (PR) is an algorithm Google uses to rank pages on the search engine results pages (or SERPs). While PR is one of many ranking signals, it provides a good indicator of ranking power. It\u2019s similar to DA, except PR is the metric Google uses. Some SEOs argue this is more important because it comes directly from Google. PR is scored on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being the highest, signifying an extremely high-ranking site. Most sites have a PR of 1-4, and it can take a while to get a new site into the higher end of the scale. PR can be a mysterious metric because Google no longer makes the scores available to the public. However, it\u2019s still an important piece of the ranking puzzle because Google uses the metric and will continue to do so and has no plans of changing that. You can use sites like CheckPageRank.net CheckPageRank.net to see how your site fares. These third party sites won\u2019t necessarily be 100% accurate, so I suggest using PR scores in tandem with Moz metrics to get a holistic view of how sites rank. Like DA, PR isn\u2019t a conclusive score. It\u2019s another helpful benchmark to have around. Wrapping it up: 3 steps for selecting dropshipping products \u00b6 I\u2019ve gone over a ton of material in this chapter, and it can feel intimidating to have so much to tackle. To make it easy, I\u2019ve condensed everything into a 3-step process that will help you find the best dropshipping products for your store. You\u2019ll want to reference the detailed instructions above, of course. Over time, as you repeat this process, it will become second nature. Step 1: Survey all of the products in your niche. \u00b6 First, you want to take a large-scale look at your niche. What categories of dropshipping products do you find? What specific products are being sold? What does this all mean for you (i.e., what products could you offer based on this research)? Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, and SEMrush to see how various products are performing. Record all of this data in a spreadsheet. I suggest keeping separate spreadsheets for each keyword tool you use to make sure all your data is organized. Don\u2019t worry about looking at specific retailers just yet during this step. You don\u2019t even have to determine if the retailers you visit are dropshipping products or not. This step is meant to give you a look at of all the different products that are being sold in the niche Once you\u2019ve gathered some keyword and dropshipping product ideas, you\u2019re ready for Step 2. Step 2: Cross-reference the products you found with best selling products from retailers. \u00b6 Now\u2019s the time to take a closer look at retailers in your niche. The goal is to find out which products are popular and which ones are on the rise. This is when you should conduct competitive analysis by using tools like Moz Open Site Explorer and PageRank checkers. You\u2019ll want a separate spreadsheet for this step to compile the data from OSE and PageRank tools. If you want, you can take a closer look at your biggest competition and cross-reference your product data from Step 1. This can help you confirm which products are selling well (and thus which products you might want to sell). Don\u2019t place your orders just yet! You\u2019re still not done finding the best dropshipping products for your store. There\u2019s still one more step left\u2026 Step 3: Make sure the products fill a need. \u00b6 This is the step most dropshippers skip. They identify the top selling products and throw up listings on a site. Maybe that was even your first instinct. However, there are many problems with simply dropshipping products that sell well. A best-selling product isn\u2019t always the one that people need the most, but obviously you want products that fly off the shelves. How do you balance these elements? If you want to sell products online, it\u2019s important to make sure your audience has a need your audience has a need for every product you offer. If you\u2019re dropshipping products that people need, those products will sell. That\u2019s almost guaranteed. But if you offer products with a history of selling well, there\u2019s no guarantee that those products will do the same for you. That\u2019s why you should start by considering consumer need. How do you make sure people need a certain product? Take a look at what they\u2019re saying. Visit websites, groups, forums, social media pages, and other channels to see how much conversation is happening for any given product. You want to see people positively discussing the product. Good reviews and product-related questions are good signs. If you can find a community around the product (or type of product), that\u2019s even better. The product in question should be helping people do something specific. If there\u2019s a lack of discussion (or negative discussion) about a product, some further research may be necessary. A complete absence of buzz around a product means you should think twice about offering it. More often than not, it will be fairly easy to tell if a product is filling a need. Here\u2019s a good test \u2013 try to state the benefit of the product in one sentence. Here are some examples: \u201cThis smart thermostat will help you control your home\u2019s temperature right from your phone.\u201d \u201cThis mug will keep your drink hotter for longer.\u201d \u201cThis chair will reduce back pain and make you comfortable.\u201d Don\u2019t stress out on this step. You don\u2019t need to be writing ad copy for the product. You just want to understand what a product does and how it helps your customers. If you can\u2019t summarize the product\u2019s benefit in one sentence, that could be problematic. The majority of helpful, valuable products are easy to describe, and their value is easy to understand. And if you can see the value of a product, your customers certainly will. Product Selection Is Ongoing \u00b6 Now you\u2019ll have a list of great dropshipping products (and the data to back it up). You should also understand why these products are valuable and what specific value they offer to customers in your niche. Don\u2019t think about product sourcing just yet. I\u2019ll address that a little later on in this guide. If you\u2019re having trouble, go back through the steps once more and try to take a more targeted approach. Consider searching for more specific product ideas or keywords, or perhaps expand the scope of your competitive analysis by finding more retailers to research. what is product selection? Image source The skills outlined in this chapter are skills I use every day, and they\u2019re incredibly useful for any dropshipper. I especially want to encourage you to get to know the various online tools. Knowing all the little features of tools like Keyword Planner and Moz OSE can really take your dropshipping store to the next level. Don\u2019t forget that product selection is an ongoing process. This won\u2019t be the last time you measure product demand and competition. If new dropshipping products show up and people start buying them, you\u2019ll obviously want to consider carrying those products those products. It\u2019s a good idea to set aside some time each month or so to conduct product research. Many experienced dropshipping merchants conduct product research on a biweekly or even weekly basis to keep their finger on the pulse of the market. You\u2019ve done a lot so far! At this point, you have all the makings of a great business. You\u2019ve done your research, chosen a niche, and picked out products. A good amount of the grunt work is over, so give yourself a pat on the back for all that you\u2019ve accomplished so far. The only thing stopping you from getting started is, well, setting up your business! You\u2019ll need to take some important steps before you go on the hunt for suppliers and source your products.

Specifically, there are certain ways to make money with products, and you have to be using at least one (preferably more) of these strategies: Gain rights to exclusive distribution or pricing . Since you can\u2019t manufacture your own dropshipping products, the next best thing is to acquire exclusive access to product distribution product distribution or pricing. If you\u2019re the only retailer offering a product (or a special low price for that product), it\u2019ll be easy to generate sales because you\u2019ll have a monopoly on that product or price point. This isn\u2019t always easy to accomplish, but it can be very lucrative if you can manage it. Sell at lower prices than your competitors . This is the approach most dropshippers take: undercut competition by dropshipping products at rock-bottom prices. But this is a business model that will eventually fail. At some point, you won\u2019t be able to sell at such low prices without taking a loss. And just think about having to compete with other retailers, especially giants like Amazon. It\u2019s just not practical, and I don\u2019t recommend doing this. Add value . I\u2019ve already stressed this, but it bears repeating. Many dropshippers don\u2019t even think to add value, which makes this one of the best strategies to use. You might add value with buyers\u2019 guides, professional quality product images, or how-to videos. Whatever you do, it\u2019s important that you can offer some sort of value in addition to dropshipping products that your customers want. When it comes to dropshipping products, adding value is the surest way to succeed. It\u2019s also the easiest strategy in many respects. Even if you know how you\u2019re going to add value to your store, you still need to think about things like pricing, marketing, product availability, product demand, and competition. Each of these areas are complex and need to be thoroughly addressed before you move on.","title":"The Basics of Selling Products Online"},{"location":"en/ch05/#pricing","text":"This is a big one. Obviously pricing is something you must consider carefully if you want to sell products online, but many entrepreneurs don\u2019t give it the attention it deserves. When it comes to dropshipping products, you need to think about how you\u2019re going to price your items and how you can price your items. price planning dropshipping Image source That\u2019s because sometimes there are limits on how you can price your items. Many manufacturers set a minimum advertised price (MAP). If a product has a MAP, it means you, as a reseller, have to price the item at or above that price. This is a great thing because it prevents retailers from dropshipping products at super-low prices and starting pricing wars. It also levels the playing field among dropshippers, which means you don\u2019t have to lower your prices just to stand out. On the flip side, MAPs limit the amount of profit you can make, but this is a small compromise for the benefits that MAPs bring. Some manufacturers don\u2019t set MAPs for their items, which makes selling a bit trickier. You could find yourself losing sales because some other store is selling the same product for less. At the same time, lowering your prices would slash your margins even more, so it\u2019s pretty much a lose-lose situation. Overall, products with MAPs are better for your bottom line. You also want to think about the price range for the items you\u2019ll offer. Although being the cheapest retailer is a bad strategy, you do want to be able to price competitively, and you\u2019ll want to offer items that are accessible to customers. This is especially true when it comes to dropshipping products that are particularly expensive. Deciding to offer pricey items can present additional issues. If your items are on the pricier side ($500 and up), potential buyers will often want to talk to a sales representative to make sure your store is legitimate and that the product is right for them. So you\u2019ll have to budget for customer support so you can answer customers\u2019 questions and give them peace of mind. That level of customer support isn\u2019t always practical if you\u2019re a solopreneur bootstrapping everything with just a laptop. That\u2019s why the range of $100 to $200 (give or take $50 or so) is often considered the sweet spot for dropshipping products. You can make a solid profit and offer appealing prices to your customers without having to spend a pretty penny on customer support solutions.","title":"Pricing"},{"location":"en/ch05/#marketing","text":"When it comes to dropshipping, marketing is very important. Even if you\u2019re not a marketing veteran, this is still something to spend some time with.

When it comes to dropshipping products, it\u2019s important not to choose items which are too easily available. What do I mean by that? Well, why do most people buy items online? Because they can\u2019t get those items anywhere else. If you\u2019re dropshipping products that are only available online, you\u2019re going to optimize your store to get the most possible sales. On the other hand, if you\u2019re dropshipping products that are widely available, people have little incentive to buy from your store. This is especially true if customers can get something from a nearby store. This is the idea of scarcity in action, and it\u2019s important for driving sales. For example, if a customer needs products like paper towels or hand soap, they\u2019ll likely head down to their local big box store. But if they\u2019re looking for a good deal on, say, a high-capacity SD card or a custom phone case, they\u2019ll probably look online instead. This basically boils down to convenience; if it\u2019s more convenient for customers to order online, they will. When you sell products online, offering items like USB chargers or cutlery isn\u2019t always profitable. These are items you can easily obtain at most brick-and-mortar stores, so it\u2019s more convenient to purchase them in real life instead of online. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t sell any items that are easily available, but you definitely shouldn\u2019t rely only on such products.","title":"Product Availability"},{"location":"en/ch05/#product-demand","text":"If a product doesn\u2019t have sufficient demand, it might be a dud.

Think about action figures of characters from movies.

However, if you want a sustainable business, the best dropshipping products are those that are in moderately high to very high demand. Selling action figures isn\u2019t going to pay the bills consistently, even though it may pay well. You want items that have steady levels of demand.

Keywords will reveal which products are being searched for. While you can\u2019t always tell if these products are selling, typically a high search volume means a product is performing well. Now you might not know anything about keyword research. That\u2019s okay! You don\u2019t need any prior knowledge to start searching like a pro. It\u2019s all in the tools you use, and the ones I\u2019ve gathered here are some of the best. I\u2019ll start with Google Keyword Planner Google Keyword Planner. There\u2019s a reason Keyword Planner is one of the most used keyword tools in the world. It\u2019s perhaps the most accessible keyword resource on the internet (and it\u2019s Google). It\u2019s also free, although you have to have an active ad campaign to use the planner. The downsides? The data is fairly general and not too comprehensive. You\u2019ll want to supplement the results you get with results from other tools (which is why I\u2019m talking about multiple tools here). That said, Keyword Planner is an excellent start, and it\u2019s definitely a tool you should use regularly. First, head to https://adwords.google.com https://adwords.google.com and make sure you\u2019re logged into the right account. Next, make sure you have an active ad campaign. You\u2019ll be able to see this in your AdWords dashboard. A campaign (or multiple campaigns) should appear in this section of the page: Google keyword planner find niche If you don\u2019t see any campaigns listed here, you\u2019ll need to create one by hitting the \u2018+ AD GROUP\u2019 button and filling out the next few pages.

Let\u2019s focus just on the chart at the bottom. keywords ideas dropship The keywords you searched are on the far left side under the category \u2018Keyword (by relevance)\u2019. The Avg. monthly searches displays the monthly search volume for that keyword. To the right, the Competition category gives you an idea of how competitive each keyword is. These two categories work in tandem to provide you with a big picture view of every keyword. In this example, \u2018water bottle\u2019 has a monthly search volume of 100,000 to 1,000,000, while both \u2018insulated water bottle\u2019 and \u2018smart water bottle\u2019 are in the 10,000 to 100,000 range. Now, these are huge ranges, which can present a problem when you\u2019re trying to figure out which dropshipping products are being searched. There\u2019s a big difference between a product that gets 10,000 searches a month and another product that gets ten times that. That\u2019s why this is the simple way. This can give you a rough idea of how popular certain dropshipping products are, but to get the most specific information, you\u2019ll want to use the in-depth way of looking at keywords using Google\u2019s tool.

You can see how many clicks the terms are receiving, their click-through rates (CTRs), average cost-per-click (CPC), and more. This is invaluable information that gives you more precise insight into the keywords you\u2019re researching. You can also adjust all of the parameters, including bid amount, date range, and locations. I know this seems like a lot, but the whole procedure is a lot faster than you might think. In time, you\u2019ll be able to crush tons of keyword searches in just a few minutes. This is a great method of getting detailed keyword results without having to study SEO for months. Get Long-Tail Keyword Ideas Another handy use of Keyword Planner generating long-tail keywords is generating long-tail keywords. Long-tail keywords are super-specific variations on keywords that usually make up most of a site\u2019s search volume. For example, if \u2018water bottle\u2019 is your focus keyword, some long-tails might be \u2018best water bottle for camping\u2019 and \u2018reusable water bottles\u2019. They\u2019re closely related to (and often include) the focus keyword. Most people will be using long-tails to search. Finding long-tails will help you find other potential dropshipping products that could be smash hits for your store. Here\u2019s how to do it using Keyword Planner.

All in all, Google Keyword Planner is a fairly formidable tool for finding potential dropshipping products if you use it the right way. It arms you with some basic figures that you can use to start understanding which products are successful and which ones are dwindling in popularity.","title":"Google Keyword Planner"},{"location":"en/ch05/#google-trends","text":"Trends is another free Google tool that can be very helpful for selecting products. It especially comes in handy for taking the product ideas you\u2019ve found through Keyword Planner and more thoroughly analyzing them. Head over to https://trends.google.com https://trends.google.com and enter a search term in the box. When you search, you\u2019ll see a few options in a dropdown menu. Start by choosing \u2018search term\u2019. The next page will give you results based on your search term. There\u2019s a lot to take in here, so let\u2019s go over the most useful elements. First, you\u2019ll see a graph called Interest over time . Google trends dropshipping niche This is a super-useful visual of search volume over a time period that you can specify. You can also change the location, date range, category, and search type. This graph can help you understand if your products are seasonal or not. Many products spike in popularity during a certain time of year, and if any products you\u2019re considering do so, you\u2019ll want to know in advance. Check out the bump in this graph: Google trends identify niches for dropshipping This means that most people buy apple butter during September and October. During the rest of the year, apple butter purchases stay at a steady rate. This is definitely a seasonal product. Next on this page, you can see Interest by region. This is helpful for understanding where you might be getting the bulk of your orders from, and this can even give you a clue how often you\u2019ll have to use international shipping. At the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll see two sections called Related topics and related queries. Here you can get even more ideas for dropshipping products! These sections basically give you long-tail topics and search terms that you can look into. (They\u2019re also useful for SEO and marketing.) Finally, don\u2019t overlook the Compare feature all the way at the top. It lets you compare two or more search terms. It\u2019s extremely convenient for deep analysis. top selling dropshipping products Overall, Trends gives you a different perspective. While its comparative features are noteworthy, there\u2019s a lot to love about this free tool.","title":"Google Trends"},{"location":"en/ch05/#semrush","text":"Want even more data? Comfortable with upping your SEO game? Then have a look at SEMrush. It\u2019s a much more comprehensive keyword tool that almost every professional SEO has used at one point or another. It can give you incredibly specific information about keywords, so you can grab keywords from Keyword Planner and enter them into SEMrush to get all the details. It\u2019s nothing short of an SEO powerhouse. The only caveat: You can only conduct 10 searches per day. You also only get 10 results for each category. This can be limiting if you want a super-thorough analysis. I still recommend SEMrush for its sheer power and usefulness. A paid plan will help you get the most out of the software, but realistically, the free plan will work for more dropshippers just starting out. Unless you have extra money burning a hole in your pocket, go with the free plan to start with. Head to SEMrush.com SEMrush.com and enter a keyword into the main search bar in the middle of the page and click \u2018Start Now\u2019. how to use SEMRush You\u2019ll see an analytics page that looks like this: SEMrush analytics page Here you can see four important headings: Organic Search, Paid Search, CPC Distribution, and Trend. Organic Search will show you the search volume (i.e., the average monthly searches for that keyword) for search that happens organically. This means that the company didn\u2019t spend money to bring in those searches. This category is key because it will reflect how many people are naturally using the keyword without the influence of any ads or campaigns. Paid Search is also important since it will give you the average CPC (cost per click) for the keyword. This amount represents how much you\u2019ll pay on average for someone to click on your ad. This isn\u2019t an exact number, but it will give you a sense of how much you\u2019re looking at spending. Wondering what CPC Distribution is? CPC distribution represents how expensive it is to bid on a particular keyword across the different PPC platforms. Clicking on a bar will give you more data. Finally, the Trend section represents the level of competition for that keyword. A score of 1 is the highest level of competition, while 0 means it has virtually no competition. Note that the Trend section only analyzes paid search, although SEMrush says it can reflect organic search as well. Scroll down on this page, and you\u2019ll see another section with two sections labeled Phrase Match Keywords and Related Keywords. SEMrush related and phase match keywords The Phrase Match Keywords include your target keyword in them. As you can see, the example target keyword I initially entered was \u2018travel water bottles\u2019, and the Phrase Match Keywords include \u2018best travel water bottle\u2019 and \u2018filter water bottle for travel\u2019. The Related Keywords section shows you keywords that are similar to your target keyword but do not necessarily include it. Some of these may be close, like \u2018best water bottles for travel\u2019. Both of these sections are great for generating long-tail keyword ideas, and you can see the volume and CPC as well. As a nice bonus, if you click on the little blue icons under the SERP heading, you\u2019ll open up a Google search for that keyword. This gives you a nice visual of what the search page looks like for a given keyword. Scroll some more, and you\u2019ll see another really helpful section titled Organic Search Results. organic search results SEMrush This is really useful because it shows you the top 100 organic results for that keyword. As I said earlier, organic traffic is essential to look at because it reflects customer interest in a product. This section will filter out all of the paid ad placements you see on Google search pages, so you see only the top organic results. There\u2019s one more part of the SEMrush analytics page that is particularly useful in a dropshipping context. If you look to the right of the Organic Search Results section, you\u2019ll see a bunch of data about ads: SEMrush competitor ad analysis Whereas Organic Search Results focused only on non-paid search, this section looks at paid search. Ads Copies will show you a few examples of ad copy for some of the top paid search ads. Here you can see four ads taken straight from the Google page, and you can conveniently see what copy they\u2019ve used. This is great for getting intel on your competition, and while it\u2019s no match for all-out competitive analysis, it\u2019s certainly a handy reference point that gives you a quick overview. It can also give you some ideas for some ad copy for your own products! Right below, you can see the Product Ads Copies category that displays pictorial ads for a couple of products. This section looks simple, and it might not seem like you can get a lot from it, but I\u2019ll break this down and show you how valuable this can be. First, you can see the title of the product. At first glance, this seems plain, but look deeper and you\u2019ll discover that you can take another peek into your competitors\u2019 SEO playbooks. That\u2019s because every product title is optimized for SEO, often containing keywords that are performing well in that niche. In this case, notice how both of these products contain the word \u2018collapsible\u2019. This suggests that \u2018collapsible travel water bottle\u2019 and other variants are doing well. If you were selling water bottles, you might want to look into offering collapsible bottles on your store and using those keywords. So you not only get a keyword idea but also a product idea, all from a few words. Second, these ad snippets display the price and the site selling them. This is another miniature form of competitive analysis. You can see who some of your competitors are and how they\u2019re pricing their products. Again, this information will only give you a rough guideline, but it\u2019s a convenient snapshot that you should look at whenever you\u2019re using SEMrush. The last section on this page is the Ads History category. ads history SEMrush This shows how actively websites were bidding on keywords. If you click on a bar, you\u2019ll see more information about which sites were bidding and how much they were bidding. I recommend using the Ads History graph to complement the knowledge you gained from Google Trends. SEMrush uses different databases than Google Trends, and it\u2019s always helpful to get data from a wide range of different sources. Learning to digest the SEMrush results page can be a little intimidating at first, so if you need some help, I suggest consulting this page from the SEMrush Knowledge Base this page from the SEMrush Knowledge Base. In addition, there are several Knowledge Base articles available that will familiarize you with the tool in no time.","title":"SEMrush"},{"location":"en/ch05/#competitors-sites","text":"Before you analyze your competitors, you can use their sites to get even more information on product trends. You\u2019ve probably guessed it by now, but there\u2019s a targeted approach to this technique that produces the best results. Have your list of potential dropshipping products handy. Visit several (7-10) retailers\u2019 sites and take a look at their top products. Usually, there will be a dropdown box on the store page that will allow you to sort products so that best selling items show first. SEMrush competitor discovery This will rearrange the product page so that the best selling items are listed first. In other words, the absolute best seller will be the first result and so on. Keep in mind that sorting this way will show you the best-selling products of all time. It won\u2019t show you the items that have sold the most over the last month or year. It\u2019s not the most helpful way to search for products, but it\u2019s still worthwhile. You might also see some stores highlighting products or marking them as \u2018top sellers\u2019. top sellers semrush These are also products to pay attention to and record on a list. This typically means the products are currently trending, and they\u2019ll likely change over time. This is good to remember because if you notice a certain product that stays in a top seller category, it may mean that item sells consistently well. Gather this data from as many stores as possible, and organize it all on a spreadsheet for easy access. I recommend using separate spreadsheets (or at least separate categories) for all of the keywords and data you get from each online tool. This way, you can continuously compile data from each tool and keep it separate for easy reference. That\u2019s going to wrap up the keyword research section of this chapter. Now I\u2019ll show you how to analyze your competitors so you know what you\u2019re up against. Fair warning \u2013 if you\u2019re not too familiar with SEO, you\u2019ll need to spend a little time learning some basic concepts and terms, but it\u2019s easy for anyone to tackle.","title":"Competitors\u2019 Sites"},{"location":"en/ch05/#analyse-your-competitors","text":"Once you have some dropshipping products selected, you\u2019ll need to scope out your competitors. This serves a twofold purpose: 1) It allows you to pinpoint your top competitors, which means you can start thinking about how you can get sales instead of them. 2) It gives you a practical understanding of which products are selling the best. Getting lots of keywords is great, but sizing up your competition is just as necessary. Since you\u2019re brand new to your niche, you\u2019ll be learning a lot from your competitors, and you can also analyze and then implement some of their techniques for areas like marketing and SEO. Thankfully, you can easily conduct competitive analysis using little more than Google. This is because Google\u2019s rankings are more or less indicative of how popular different retailers are. The higher up a site is on the SERPs, the more powerful it is, so retailers with high SERPs SERP positions are typically leaders in their niches. Because Google is set up like this, you can get a surface level view of your competition by simply Googling a product name and seeing which retailers come up. This won\u2019t give you exact statistics, so you need to use some additional tools to get the real juicy data.","title":"Analyse Your Competitors"},{"location":"en/ch05/#moz-open-site-explorer","text":"Moz is one of the biggest names in SEO, and its Open Site Explorer tool is one of the best free SEO tools available. Often abbreviated to OSE, this is a link analysis tool that gives you a ton of information about a website. You can see how popular the website is, how much traffic it gets, and how many backlinks it has. (You can even get details on where those backlinks come from!) It\u2019s unparalleled for understanding how influential your competitors are. To take full advantage of all that OSE has to offer, you first have to understand a few terms and concepts. You don\u2019t have to be a trained SEO to get a good grasp of this, so don\u2019t fret if you don\u2019t have much experience. The main concepts are Domain Authority, Page Authority, and link structure. The best way to show you what all of these are is to see them in action. First, go to https://moz.com/researchtools/ose https://moz.com/researchtools/ose. Enter a URL into the search bar in the middle of the page and click \u2018Search\u2019. You\u2019ll see a results page that looks like this: Moz site explorer dropship To start off, look at just the category titled Authority. moz page authority There are three important metrics here: Domain Authority, Page Authority, and Spam Score. Domain Authority (DA) is a metric that Moz developed to display how well a domain will rank in search engines. 100 is the best possible DA score. Basically, the higher a site\u2019s DA score, the more likely a site is to rank well. If your site has a DA of 90, you can usually expect to rank on page 1. On the other hand, if your site has a DA of 25, it probably won\u2019t rank too well. DA is best for considering the general impact of a site. A high DA means that the site gets a high amount of traffic to its homepage and most of its other pages. That\u2019s why sites with higher DA scores will usually be your top competitors. Keep in mind that DA is not the final word on how a site will rank. It\u2019s simply a benchmark. You also don\u2019t need a high DA to rank on page 1 of the SERPs. Specific pages may rank better than the overall site they belong to, which brings me to the next metric\u2026 Page Authority (PA) is nearly identical to Domain Authority, except it analyzes the ranking strength of individual pages. This allows you to predict how well certain pages on your site (or on your competitors\u2019 sites) will rank. PA is useful for understanding the impact of a certain product page. When you enter in a specific URL, you\u2019ll want to look at the PA score to see how powerful that page is. It\u2019s good to check the PA scores of best selling product pages and compare those to the overall DA of the site. If both are high, that means the site gets a lot of traffic and probably sells a lot. If PA is high but DA is low, the site doesn\u2019t get a lot of traffic but likely sells certain items more than others. Finally, Spam Score checks to make sure a site is legitimate. Moz can tell when a site is set up for spam purposes, and that\u2019s where this signal comes in. 0 is where you want to be. To recap everything so far: High DA and PA scores are good, while a low spam score is ideal. Together, these three metrics will give you an idea of how well a site will rank. Now let\u2019s move on to the section called Page Link Metrics. page link metrics moz The Just-Discovered section can indicate how popular a site or page has become in the last 60 days. If you see a high number here, it means the site has gained a lot of backlinks in the last couple of months. The Established Links section is even more valuable. It shows you how many root domains and total links there are. The number of root domains shows you how many unique domains have linked to the site, while total links include any and all links, not just root domains. So if fakewebsite.com linked to your site twice, it would count as one root domain and two total links (since it\u2019s the same domain linking multiple times). A site with a high number of root domains will usually rank very well for several terms. This is generally the more important metric of the two. Why? Because Google prefers sites with lots of unique root domains and will rank them higher than sites with fewer root domain links. With that said, the number of total links can also help gauge how impactful a site is, since a high number of total links means the site has probably gotten multiple links from the same sites. This number also reflects the site\u2019s total reach and influence. At the bottom, you can see the specific inbound links (i.e., links pointing to the specific site or page). You can also filter results in case you want to see specific link types, which can be useful. moz inbound links There are a couple of reasons you might want to find out who is linking to your competitors. First, it shows you which sites you might be able to get backlinks from. Maybe you\u2019ll find some sites that feature dropshipping products or use affiliate programs to connect with retailers. Later on, when you\u2019re building an SEO strategy of your own, this information is nice to have. Second, you can personally check the credibility and quality of each backlink. For example, a site might get a ton of links but they could all come from shady sites. On the other hand, if popular sites are linking, then you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the competitor you\u2019re researching. There\u2019s one more item of note on this page: the Compare Link Metrics option. This is located in the menu on the left hand side: compare link metrics moz This feature allows you to compare multiple sites and see how their metrics stack up. For competitive analysis, this is a goldmine. You can pit your site directly against your competitors\u2019 or even compare multiple competitors against each other. Simply click \u2018Add URL\u2019, enter the address, and you\u2019ll get a neat chart with all the important metrics listed. moz page specific metrics Don\u2019t overlook this feature. It\u2019s one of my favorites for comparing competitors and seeing how my site is doing. All in all, OSE is a stellar resource, and it\u2019ll quickly become a part of your daily business routine.","title":"Moz Open Site Explorer"},{"location":"en/ch05/#pagerank-checkers","text":"PageRank (PR) is an algorithm Google uses to rank pages on the search engine results pages (or SERPs). While PR is one of many ranking signals, it provides a good indicator of ranking power. It\u2019s similar to DA, except PR is the metric Google uses. Some SEOs argue this is more important because it comes directly from Google. PR is scored on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being the highest, signifying an extremely high-ranking site. Most sites have a PR of 1-4, and it can take a while to get a new site into the higher end of the scale. PR can be a mysterious metric because Google no longer makes the scores available to the public. However, it\u2019s still an important piece of the ranking puzzle because Google uses the metric and will continue to do so and has no plans of changing that. You can use sites like CheckPageRank.net CheckPageRank.net to see how your site fares. These third party sites won\u2019t necessarily be 100% accurate, so I suggest using PR scores in tandem with Moz metrics to get a holistic view of how sites rank.

A best-selling product isn\u2019t always the one that people need the most, but obviously you want products that fly off the shelves. How do you balance these elements? If you want to sell products online, it\u2019s important to make sure your audience has a need your audience has a need for every product you offer.

But if you offer products with a history of selling well, there\u2019s no guarantee that those products will do the same for you. That\u2019s why you should start by considering consumer need. How do you make sure people need a certain product? Take a look at what they\u2019re saying. Visit websites, groups, forums, social media pages, and other channels to see how much conversation is happening for any given product. You want to see people positively discussing the product. Good reviews and product-related questions are good signs. If you can find a community around the product (or type of product), that\u2019s even better. The product in question should be helping people do something specific. If there\u2019s a lack of discussion (or negative discussion) about a product, some further research may be necessary.

Keep in mind that a sole proprietorship offers no liability protection, so if your business is sued, your personal assets could be in trouble. So while a sole proprietorship is easiest to get started with, it\u2019s not necessarily the best. Partnership . If you want to start up your business with a partner, your company may fall under partnership jurisdiction. This is simply \u2018the relationship existing between two or more persons who join to carry on a trade or business,\u2019 according to the IRS according to the IRS. Partners must file an annual information return, but the business does not pay income tax. Instead, each partner reports his or her profits and losses. Obviously, for solo entrepreneurs, this structure doesn\u2019t apply. Many dropshipping stores are run by one person, so you don\u2019t see this structure a lot. However, it\u2019s definitely useful in some cases, and you should be aware of it in case you\u2019re co-founding a business with a partner. Limited Liability Company (LLC) Limited Liability Company (LLC) . Ever seen a business name with LLC at the end? That means it\u2019s a Limited Liability Company. Under this structure, personal and business finances are separated, meaning your business will be a separate legal entity from your personal finances. This affords more protection than a sole proprietorship, but it doesn\u2019t come with the heavy regulations that a C Corporation demands. You\u2019ll often see medium-sized businesses opt for an LLC, and it\u2019s appealing for its balance of protection and flexibility. Even though it\u2019s popular, it may or may not be right for you. Check out the IRS guidelines on LLCs the IRS guidelines on LLCs as well as any local rules that apply. C Corporation C Corporation . This option provides the highest level of liability protection. This is how most major businesses are set up. However, becoming a C Corp is a more complex process, and a C Corp may be subject to double taxation. For most dropshippers, this option is off the table. However, more ambitious entrepreneurs might want to give it a look. Here\u2019s some information from the IRS on C Corps Here\u2019s some information from the IRS on C Corps. Again, since I\u2019m not a legal expert, I can\u2019t suggest one of these structures. I can say that most entrepreneurs who have smaller businesses usually choose a sole proprietorship or an LLC. A one-person business isn\u2019t too complex to set up, but a business attorney can help you make the best choices and help you protect yourself, your personal assets, and your business from harm. Another reason to consult an attorney is that different states have different requirements for businesses. A professional in your state will be able to tell you everything you need to know about incorporating. If you don\u2019t know where to start looking, look at this FindLaw page this FindLaw page that lists business and commercial lawyers by state. Remember, the business structure you choose will determine much of how you have to run your business, so make sure the one you pick is the best for you. Getting your Employer Identification Number (EIN) \u00b6 This is a small but important step. Most people who run a business are required to have an EIN. An EIN is used by the IRS to identify a business entity. An EIN is like a Social Security number for a business, so it\u2019s important to have. Thankfully, it\u2019s a snap to get one. You can apply for one online here You can apply for one online here. However, not all business owners need an EIN. Visit this page to see if you need one or not. Miscellaneous Legal Necessities \u00b6 When it comes to legal must-haves, there\u2019s much more than what I\u2019ve discussed in this chapter. Trademarking your store name, making your email list legal, and protecting your customers\u2019 data are a few of the considerations you\u2019ll want to make. Shopify created the Definitive Legal Guide to Ecommerce Definitive Legal Guide to Ecommerce to help with some of these areas. However, this guide is not legal advice, so it can only share information like I\u2019ve done in this chapter. Depending on where you are, different rules may apply, so it\u2019s always best to consult a local attorney. Your state and city might have official information on starting an online business, and often there are specific rules for entrepreneurs who operate a business from their home. Finances \u00b6 Business finances are much more extensive than personal finances, so you\u2019ll want to make absolutely sure you have everything set up and ready to go. The term \u2018finances\u2019 is broadly applied to a range of financial matters, including taxes and payment processing. If you\u2019re using an ecommerce solution like Shopify, you\u2019ll find business finances become a whole lot easier. However, you still need to read up on financial requirements. While ecommerce solutions simplify finances, they don\u2019t eliminate them. A sturdy financial foundation will protect your business and make selling easy. It takes some work upfront, and you\u2019ll want to consult an attorney for most of these matters as well. Here are some of the things you\u2019ll need to do: Open a Business Checking Account \u00b6 In most cases, you\u2019ll want your business income to be separate from your personal income. This simplifies accounting simplifies accounting, makes finances easier to manage, and affords you some extra protection. Do some research Do some research to find a bank that offers a solid business account. It\u2019s perfectly fine to use different banks for your personal and business income streams. Don\u2019t forget to look at online banks. An online checking account may come with lower fees, but there could also be some limitations. Whether you choose an online bank or not, make sure the bank you\u2019re dealing with is reputable and FDIC insured. Even if you\u2019re not expecting to pull in high volume sales, a business checking account is still nice to have. Separating your income streams will save you countless headaches, and your CPA will thank you once tax time rolls around. Get a Business Credit Card \u00b6 For business-related purchases, a dedicated credit card is a necessity whether you\u2019re buying inventory or charging a business expense. Just like you should have a checking account for business only, you should have a credit card that is solely used for business. Your business credit card will mostly be used to order from suppliers. There are other ways to pay, but a credit card is one of the most flexible methods, and it\u2019s accepted everywhere. This also gives you the opportunity to make use of credit cards with rewards programs. Since you\u2019ll be making fairly large purchases on a regular basis, you can easily rack up rewards. This isn\u2019t a necessity, but it\u2019s certainly a nice feature that you might as well take advantage of. Create a Business Paypal Account \u00b6 If you plan to accept PayPal, you\u2019ll need a separate business account to process payment. Again, the goal here is to separate personal and business finances, so don\u2019t use your personal PayPal account for your store. It\u2019s easy to sign up for a business account, but be aware of the fees and restrictions that come with it. You\u2019ll deal with different fee amounts depending on factors like the size of the order and the location of the customer. Here\u2019s the information straight from PayPal Here\u2019s the information straight from PayPal. PayPal isn\u2019t the only option for paying online, although it is the most popular. If you want to accept other forms of payment, like Stripe or Bitcoin, you\u2019ll need to set up business accounts for each one. And make sure you have a method of accepting credit cards! Get Your Taxes and Accounting in Order \u00b6 Before you open the doors to your business, make sure you know what you need to do for taxes and accounting taxes and accounting. Reach out to a professional tax and accounting expert to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations involved. Depending on which business structure you choose and which local and state rules apply, your processes for filing and paying tax will likely be different from how you normally file and pay. In addition, come up with a way of organizing your finances, recording your income, and logging expenses. Taking care of this on a consistent basis will help keep your finances headache-free. Trust me, you don\u2019t want to have to dig up everything a month before tax season. Understand When to Collect State Tax on Purchases \u00b6 This is a rule that\u2019s good to know in advance. You only need to collect state tax if both of these criteria are met: The state your business operates from collects sales tax Someone from your state places an order from your site Most orders won\u2019t be eligible for sales tax, but some will, and you\u2019ll need to be prepared for those. Be sure to contact the Department of Commerce in your state to register and get more information about rules you need to follow. See If You Need a Local Business License \u00b6 Since most dropshipping businesses are operated out of home offices, a local local business license may or may not be necessary business license may or may not be necessary. You\u2019ll need to contact your city to find out if you need one or not. Even if you end up not needing a business license, you may need to obey certain local rules that govern home businesses. Make Sure Your Office Space Is in the Clear \u00b6 Having a home office is usually a straightforward process, but sometimes there are snags. For example, you might need a local business license. However, in some cases, there\u2019s a few more formalities involved. If you\u2019re part of a Homeowners Association (HOA), you may have to follow specific regulations for running a business from your residence. Alternatively, you could choose to rent an office or coworking space, but this usually isn\u2019t cost effective for most entrepreneurs. Don\u2019t forget to read up on what tax deductions you can take advantage of. You can write off or depreciate items that you buy for work, and you may be able to use other deductions as well. What About International Entrepreneurs? \u00b6 Not in the United States? As always, I recommend consulting with legal and business professionals near you to determine exactly what steps you need to follow in order to establish a business in your area. You should know that you still can incorporate in the US, but you\u2019ll need to jump through some hoops to make it happen. A business law expert will be able to help you decide if it\u2019s better for you to incorporate in your country or the US.

Finding Legal Help near You \u00b6 As I\u2019ve said throughout this chapter, nothing beats local legal help when it comes to setting up a business.

Right now, you have a business concept ready to go, but it\u2019s not a bona fide business just yet. You need to make it legal, set up an official business framework, and make sure you\u2019re abiding by all the right rules. This is often the step that intimidates would-be dropshippers the most.

If you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of the administrative stuff out of the way, and you\u2019re ready to start building your actual store. Earlier I mentioned we\u2019d be covering different sales channels. This is such a deep topic that I\u2019ve devoted an entire chapter to it. A sales channel is a platform you use to sell products. This can be a Shopify store Shopify store, a dropshipping website of your own, or a seller account on a product site like eBay. The sales channel is another foundational element to a dropshipping business. The platform you use to sell will determine how you sell. You\u2019ll be subject to the flexibility (or lack of flexibility) of your channel, and the audience you reach (and how you reach them) will be extremely dependent on the sales platform you choose. As you might be able to guess, there are lots of options out there. This is mostly a good thing, but it can leave you confused as to what you should choose. Each sales channel has its own pros and cons, and you need to closely evaluate them before you make a decision. You can use multiple sales channels if you want, but you\u2019ll have to juggle all the different tasks and responsibilities. In most situations, this isn\u2019t too difficult, but you might want to start out with just one sales channel and then start using others. There are three popular sales platforms: eBay, Amazon, and custom online storefronts (typically using ecommerce software or plugins). None of these platforms are inherently better or worse than the others, so you\u2019ll have to spend some time familiarizing yourself with each one. You\u2019ll likely find that one option is best for you. Dropshipping on Amazon \u00b6 When it comes to choosing a dropshipping website, Amazon seems like an easy choice. It\u2019s one of the biggest online marketplaces in the world, and it\u2019s a hotspot for dropshippers. dropshipping on amazon Source Many of the products you see listed on Amazon are actually sold by third-party merchants. But is Amazon really that good for dropshippers? There\u2019s no doubt that Amazon has plenty of advantages, but it\u2019s not without its own issues. In some ways it\u2019s convenient, and in other ways it can be really detrimental to dropshippers. Here are some of the pros and cons you should be aware of if you\u2019re considering using Amazon as your first dropshipping platform. Pros of Dropshipping on Amazon \u00b6 It exposes your products to an enormous audience . By listing your products on Amazon, you\u2019ll instantly get in front of millions and millions of people millions and millions of people. This is the kind of attention you\u2019d have to spend years to achieve on your own. And since many Amazon shoppers buy from third party merchants, you\u2019re almost guaranteed a colossal amount of free traffic no matter what you\u2019re selling. It\u2019s trustworthy . These days, people treat Amazon like a local big box store. Shopping on Amazon has become a casual affair, and it\u2019s often where people go to buy any number of products. That means your customers might already regularly browse Amazon to purchase items they need. You get access to Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) . With FBA, retailers ship products to Amazon, who then ships out the orders. If you have products of your own to sell, FBA can give you an additional revenue stream. This isn\u2019t a huge perk, but it\u2019s nice to have. Cons of Dropshipping on Amazon \u00b6 The listing fees are substantial . Like eBay, Amazon imposes hefty listing fees that are typically in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 percent. And that\u2019s on top of the monthly $39.99 base fee. If your margins are already low, this will cut into your profits quite heavily, but it\u2019s the cost you\u2019ll have to pay if you want that potential exposure to millions of buyers. The competition is insane . Amazon\u2019s popularity is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it means lots of people will see (and hopefully buy) your products. On the other hand, it means there\u2019s lots of competition. It doesn\u2019t help that many third-party Amazon sellers automate their listings to continuously adjust their prices to be the lowest. This creates pricing wars, which is bad news for dropshippers. Undercutting your competition all the time is no way to stay in business, so this is a real problem for dropshippers. The payment situation isn\u2019t ideal for everyone . There are two big problems with how Amazon deals with payment. First, it doesn\u2019t accept PayPal. This is obviously a huge issue, as PayPal is how millions of people prefer to pay. Second, sellers only get paid every two weeks, and this is less than ideal for many entrepreneurs. Dropshipping on eBay \u00b6 To put it lightly, eBay is an enormous sales platform. Many people trust eBay, and millions of people millions of people use it to go shopping and buy products. It\u2019s similar to Amazon in many respects, and the two sites share many of the same advantages. dropshipping on ebay However, since eBay is an auction site, it\u2019s a little different than the other two options. It can be invaluable for dropshippers just starting out, but it comes at a price \u2013 literally. Pros of Dropshipping on Ebay \u00b6 It\u2019s huge . One of eBay\u2019s most appealing features is its sheer size. Dropshipping on eBay will give you instant access to millions of customers who have their wallets out, ready to buy. This means you can do less marketing and work more on leveraging the platform itself. It\u2019s easy . Dropshipping on eBay is easy to set up. You can easily manage everything all by yourself without the need for any assistants or team members. If that weren\u2019t enough, eBay makes payment processing and finances a lot easier. It\u2019s trustworthy . Customers trust eBay because of its seller protection policies, which can benefit new dropshippers. Many buyers will purchase from brand new sellers because they know they\u2019re covered if something goes wrong. This makes it easy for you to attract customers and build a positive reputation. Cons of Dropshipping on Ebay \u00b6 The fees can add up . eBay is notorious for its high fees \u2013 the ecommerce giant takes up to 10 percent of a sale (and in rare cases, even more). These fees are somewhat of a necessary evil and a tradeoff for selling on such a big platform, but this does dissuade some entrepreneurs from choosing eBay as a dropshipping platform. Its auction style isn\u2019t always ideal for dropshipping . With a dropshipping business model, you list a product and keep that listing up indefinitely. eBay doesn\u2019t work like this because it\u2019s an auction platform, which means there\u2019s a time limit for all listings. You\u2019ll have to relist your items once the listings expire. This can be time consuming and make you postpone more important things. It\u2019s limiting . With eBay, your hands are tied. There\u2019s a lot you can\u2019t do, like build an email list or design your own storefront. You have to play by eBay\u2019s rules, and you\u2019re more or less stuck on eBay. This means you won\u2019t get many repeat customers, you can\u2019t really build an audience, and you can\u2019t brand yourself. Suffice it to say, this can get frustrating. It can also make it harder for you to stand out since virtually every eBay store looks exactly the same. Dropshipping on Your Own Website \u00b6 While it won\u2019t give you the ability to get your inventory in front of millions of customers, a dropshipping website of your very own can provide you with advantages you won\u2019t get any other way. You\u2019ll get a lot of freedom, but you\u2019ll have to make some compromises. Setting up a dropshipping website from scratch may sound overwhelming, especially if you don\u2019t have any prior experience, but it\u2019s surprisingly easy thanks to ecommerce software like Shopify. You can easily create a site and integrate an ecommerce plugin to make your store, no experience necessary. Chapter 3 Chapter 3 of Oberlo\u2019s Make Money From Home ebook offers some insight into the process. But is this the right choice for you? Here are some points to think about. Pros of Setting up Your Own Dropshipping Website \u00b6 You have complete control . You can decide everything that makes up your store, from the placement of your logo to the format of your pages. Most importantly, you can communicate your value to your readers, and this can give you a serious edge over your competition. You don\u2019t have to pay outrageous fees . Without a third party to take a cut, you can considerably increase your profit margins. Those 10 to 15 percent listing fees that Amazon and eBay charge? Forget about them. You now only have to worry about payment processor fees and the cost of the actual products. It\u2019s easier for customers to buy on mobile . Ever tried to use your mobile device to buy something off a sales platform like Amazon or eBay? It\u2019s not always pleasant. With your own dropshipping website, you can easily make your site responsive and mobile-friendly for your customers. Better yet, if you use a platform like Shopify, you can manage your entire business from your mobile device, so you can keep an eye on things even when you\u2019re on the go. You can stand out . All Amazon pages look the same, just like all eBay pages look the same. Having a dropshipping website of your own lets you implement your branding and make a lasting impression on your audience. This can make a big difference, and it will help you build your brand and draw in a loyal audience of return customers. There are other benefits as well, which you can learn about by watching our video: Dropshipping vs Amazon. Cons of Setting up Your Own Dropshipping Website \u00b6 You don\u2019t have access to a large audience . Having your own site means building an audience from the ground up. You\u2019ll have to put more time, money, and effort into marketing, traffic generation, and outreach. It can take a long time to get off the ground . You won\u2019t be making sales immediately like you would on Amazon or eBay. It\u2019s going to take some time to attract customers and make consistent sales. How to Choose a Sales Platform \u00b6 So you might be asking yourself, \u201cWhich dropshipping platform is right for me?\u201d I can\u2019t decide for you, but I can help. To choose the best platform choose the best platform for your business, you\u2019ll need to ask some questions and evaluate your priorities. First, think about which is more important to you: higher profit margins or more exposure to an audience. If you\u2019re interested in making the most money, you should probably consider creating a dropshipping website of your own. This strategy will take longer, but you\u2019ll wind up with more money in your pocket, and you\u2019ll be able to build a customer base. If you\u2019re more interested in getting your product in front of lots of people, then Amazon or eBay may be right for you. This will cut your margins, but you\u2019ll get sales more quickly. Second, think about your long-term goals. How do you want to be selling your product a year from now? What about five years from now? In other words, how much control do you want over selling your products? Your own dropshipping website will give you the most control, while platforms like Amazon or eBay will limit you in many ways. When it comes to control over branding, sales, and pretty much everything else, a website of your own is hard to beat. Finally \u2013 and this is the most important factor \u2013 think about how you\u2019ll bring value to your customers. More specifically, think about which platform will allow you to provide the most value. I discussed earlier different ways to provide value, and you might have a few ideas in mind. Which sales platform(s) will best facilitate those ideas? Personally, I\u2019ve had the best experience with a custom dropshipping website paired with ecommerce software like Shopify. It gives you a ton of control, makes it easy to sell, and increases your profit margins. It also gives you more opportunities to brand yourself, retain customers, and market your store. While you can switch to another dropshipping platform rather easily, there\u2019s one thing to bear in mind. If you start out on Amazon or eBay and want to move to a dropshipping website of your own, you\u2019ll have no way to relocate your customer base to your own site. Your positive reviews and customer experiences will be confined to that platform. Regardless of which platform you opt for, you\u2019ll need to think about branding and digital marketing. You can have the best products and still fall short if you don\u2019t have a memorable brand. The good news is that with a little bit of know-how, you can create an amazing brand that will help your business stand head and shoulders above your competition.","title":"Choosing a Sales Platform"},{"location":"en/ch07/#choosing-a-sales-platform","text":"Dropshipping 101: Ecommerce Without Inventory | Choosing a Sales Platform Chapter 7 by Daniel Threlfall 30 Jun, 2020 It\u2019s finally time to get into the good stuff: making sales. If you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019ve gotten a lot of the administrative stuff out of the way, and you\u2019re ready to start building your actual store. Earlier I mentioned we\u2019d be covering different sales channels. This is such a deep topic that I\u2019ve devoted an entire chapter to it. A sales channel is a platform you use to sell products. This can be a Shopify store Shopify store, a dropshipping website of your own, or a seller account on a product site like eBay. The sales channel is another foundational element to a dropshipping business. The platform you use to sell will determine how you sell. You\u2019ll be subject to the flexibility (or lack of flexibility) of your channel, and the audience you reach (and how you reach them) will be extremely dependent on the sales platform you choose. As you might be able to guess, there are lots of options out there. This is mostly a good thing, but it can leave you confused as to what you should choose. Each sales channel has its own pros and cons, and you need to closely evaluate them before you make a decision. You can use multiple sales channels if you want, but you\u2019ll have to juggle all the different tasks and responsibilities. In most situations, this isn\u2019t too difficult, but you might want to start out with just one sales channel and then start using others. There are three popular sales platforms: eBay, Amazon, and custom online storefronts (typically using ecommerce software or plugins). None of these platforms are inherently better or worse than the others, so you\u2019ll have to spend some time familiarizing yourself with each one. You\u2019ll likely find that one option is best for you.","title":"Choosing a Sales Platform"},{"location":"en/ch07/#dropshipping-on-amazon","text":"When it comes to choosing a dropshipping website, Amazon seems like an easy choice. It\u2019s one of the biggest online marketplaces in the world, and it\u2019s a hotspot for dropshippers. dropshipping on amazon Source Many of the products you see listed on Amazon are actually sold by third-party merchants. But is Amazon really that good for dropshippers? There\u2019s no doubt that Amazon has plenty of advantages, but it\u2019s not without its own issues.

By listing your products on Amazon, you\u2019ll instantly get in front of millions and millions of people millions and millions of people.

And since many Amazon shoppers buy from third party merchants, you\u2019re almost guaranteed a colossal amount of free traffic no matter what you\u2019re selling. It\u2019s trustworthy . These days, people treat Amazon like a local big box store. Shopping on Amazon has become a casual affair, and it\u2019s often where people go to buy any number of products. That means your customers might already regularly browse Amazon to purchase items they need. You get access to Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) . With FBA, retailers ship products to Amazon, who then ships out the orders. If you have products of your own to sell, FBA can give you an additional revenue stream.

I\u2019ve gone over a lot of the brass tacks, from niche selection to incorporation. You\u2019ve come a long way, but there\u2019s still some important steps ahead. Even though I\u2019ve talked about building your business, a business isn\u2019t truly a complete business without a unique identity. That\u2019s where branding comes in That\u2019s where branding comes in. The right branding can establish your business as a trustworthy retailer and help with marketing too. It\u2019s what helps certain retailers rise above the others and stick in customers\u2019 minds. Think of your favorite company. You probably know their logo, the tone of voice they use for advertisements, and maybe even their slogan. These elements are important for a memorable brand, and to really stand out, you\u2019ll need to put some serious work into developing a robust brand. Many dropshipping stores don\u2019t have a brand. Think of all of the online storefronts that look the same. They\u2019re interchangeable. They give you no compelling reason to buy from them. Building a brand takes effort, and some dropshipping stores are only out to make fast cash. That\u2019s why so many dropshippers offer rock bottom prices. Nevertheless, a brand is crucial. Customers know a good brand when they see one. The best companies in the world have awesome brands, so why shouldn\u2019t your store have one? However, the concept of branding can be a little confusing or vague. What exactly goes into a brand? What\u2019s the process behind branding? As a whole, branding far exceeds the scope of this guide, but I\u2019ll get into the basics to get you started. First I\u2019ll define what a brand is, and then I\u2019ll show you what you need to focus on to brand your business. What Is Branding? \u00b6 You know that every company has a brand, something that makes each business unique something that makes each business unique. So a brand is essentially a company\u2019s identity. Just like no two people are alike, no two businesses are alike, and brands are what make them all different. If you want, you can think of a brand as a company\u2019s personality. A brand tells your customers who you are and what you\u2019re about. It\u2019s the essence of your business essence of your business \u2013 the who, what, and why, so to speak. Lots of companies treat branding as an afterthought. If you go that route, you\u2019ll find it difficult to gain traction and get new customers. Without a brand, your business won\u2019t be memorable, and it won\u2019t make prospective customers think it\u2019s special. This is the reason why a lot of first time dropshippers give up and quit. They don\u2019t spend enough time on branding. Branding is the thread that runs through your entire business. Everything about your business should be infused with your brand. Your social media, marketing strategies, and even ad copy will all reflect your brand. Branding is both internal and external. Internal branding deals with your mission statement and company values, while external branding deals with aspects like design and copy. Also, branding is part of the value you provide to your audience. Whether or not your customers are loyal will largely depend on how much your brand resonates with them. A remarkable brand will attract customers by connecting with them and help turn casual shoppers into loyal followers. First, let\u2019s discuss internal branding Internal Branding \u00b6 Whether you\u2019re a solopreneur or the head of a small team, your company needs internal branding. This may seem insignificant, but I urge you to not ignore it. internal branding Image source Internal branding Internal branding allows you (and any team members you have) to understand what your company stands for. It\u2019s another way of saying your company is focused on its customers. And while your customers aren\u2019t ever going to see what your internal branding is like, your public presence will reflect the attitude you maintain. A good internal brand ensures everyone is on the same page and facilitates an optimal work ethic. Two common ways of implementing internal branding are the mission statement and a list of values. Creating a Mission Statement \u00b6 Throughout this book, I\u2019ve placed a heavy emphasis on value. By now, I hope you\u2019ve gained a value-first mindset that focuses on how you can best serve your audience. This idea of value first is integral to a successful mission statement. Mission statements can sometimes seem corny or disingenuous, but a good mission statement can work wonders for your business by giving you a customer-centric perspective. You\u2019ve probably seen lots of mission statements before, but if you haven\u2019t, here are some famous examples here are some famous examples: Warby Parker : \u201cTo offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially-conscious businesses.\u201d Nordstrom : \u201cTo give customers the most compelling shopping experience possible.\u201d JetBlue : \u201cTo inspire humanity \u2013 both in the air and on the ground.\u201d These mission statements are more than hollow platitudes to whip up some good PR. They\u2019re designed to guide each and every worker in everything he or she does. A good mission statement improves morale, creates a positive environment, and helps everyone communicate better. To see the power of the mission statement in action, take a second look at those mission statements above. They\u2019re all about what the company does for the customer. This is vital because if your mission statement is all about your company, it\u2019s not going to work well. Just like you\u2019ve developed a value-first mindset, you have to develop a value-first mission statement. Again, this may seem like overkill for a dropshipping business, but trust me \u2013 not many dropshippers take this seriously. It may not always be obvious, but most successful dropshippers with great brands have an outstanding mission statement that\u2019s driving them. This is how companies like IKEA work. You may not realize it at first, but IKEA\u2019s goal of helping more people can create a better everyday life at home affects everything they do affects everything they do, from product design to store layout. This is exactly the kind of internal structure you want to create for your dropshipping business (even if it\u2019s just you right now). It\u2019s also important to establish your internal branding before you start working on any external branding. It\u2019s like building a house on a sturdy foundation. Your external branding is the house, and your internal branding is the foundation. Not an expert on crafting inspirational mission statements? Don\u2019t worry. Here are a few tips to give you a boost. Don\u2019t make your mission statement self-serving . Like I said, you have to put your customer base first, and that means refraining from overloading your mission statement with \u2018we\u2019. Yes, your mission statement is about your company, but only about what your company can offer. Don\u2019t get too caught up in your ambition and lose sight of that. Think in verbs . The mission statements listed above all start with \u201cto ____\u201d. To offer, to give, to inspire. These are all verbs, and who is the recipient of these actions? The customer. If you think of what your company does in terms of verbs, it\u2019s easier to maintain the focus on your customers and not yourself. Reflect on why your company does what it does . Every company needs a fundamental reason to exist, often simply called a \u2018why\u2019. If your why is just to sell and make money, that\u2019s not good. Your business needs to have a reason to improve people\u2019s lives somehow. You then need to incorporate that reason into your mission statement. Warby Parker\u2019s mission statement does this wonderfully: \u201cTo offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially-conscious businesses.\u201d You\u2019ll want to draft several mission statements, anywhere from 10-30. It\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t sound perfect. Right now, you want to think of as many statements as possible to give you the most options to work with. Next, narrow it down. Which mission statements summarize your goals best? Which ones would you identify with most if you were the customer? You might need to change your mission statement over time. As your business grows, you\u2019ll get a better idea of the value you provide and what your specific objectives are. Update your mission statement accordingly and make sure everyone on your team knows what it is. Here\u2019s an excellent guide from The Balance Here\u2019s an excellent guide from The Balance that provides some tips for writing a great mission statement. This step helps you think like the most successful businesses in the world and allows you to align actions with goals. External Branding \u00b6 External branding is complex to talk about because everything you do represents your brand. Your logo, customer support emails, and social media avatars are all part of your brand. (This is why internal branding is so important \u2013 you need to understand who you are before you go public.) external branding Image source The basic elements of a brand are how you look and how you sound. Your business logo and website (or storefront) will often be the first thing a new customer sees, so they need to make good first impressions. Next, the tone and style of writing you use will affect everything from sales to social shares. Text and media are how you\u2019ll communicate with your customers, so everything you put out needs to make sense with your brand. Let\u2019s break down these parts (logo, website, writing), and discuss them each in depth. Logo Design \u00b6 There\u2019s a reason big businesses spend millions on logo design. It\u2019s because your logo is more than just a nice design. It\u2019s a way for people to instantly recognize your brand. I bet you can think of at least 10 different logos right now. Logos have tons of power. Humans are visual creatures, so when you and I see a logo for a business we love, we\u2019ll commit it to memory almost subconsciously. You\u2019ll use your logo on your storefront, your social media accounts, your business cards, and even your email profile picture. All of your customers are going to see it, so why not make it the best it can be? Because a good logo can be a little pricey, many entrepreneurs opt to choose a free logo they can make themselves they can make themselves. The problem with this? If you have no design skills at all, your logo will look generic and forgettable. That\u2019s why you need a logo that\u2019s tailor-made for your brand. You don\u2019t need to spend thousands of dollars, but you should be prepared to pay a fair rate for a custom designed logo from a qualified designer. That way you won\u2019t be just another store with a boring logo. A custom logo is an easy way to stand out from your competition. First, you should have an idea of the aesthetic you want for your brand. Do you want to have a more formal or a more casual look? What feelings do you want to evoke in your customers? A good designer will be able to guide you, but it\u2019s good to ask these questions beforehand. It\u2019s helpful to find a bunch of logos you like and try to figure out what you like about them. What makes them unique to you? Thinking about this makes a logo designer\u2019s job easier because they\u2019ll be able to come up with ideas that reflect what you want in a logo. Second, you should be prepared to pay. How much should you spend? Costs vary from designer to designer, but a good price range to shoot for is the $100 to $300 range. Logo design takes a lot of work, and designers who charge too little often skimp on quality. If you get a quote in the $100 to $300 range, you\u2019ll likely be dealing with someone who takes his or her job seriously. So how do you find a logo designer? It\u2019s worth reaching out to your network and seeing if you can find a designer that way. This is a great way to find people you can trust and build relationships with them. If you can\u2019t find anyone through your network, there are tons of sites that allow you to get a well designed logo that doesn\u2019t put you in debt. Here are a few options. Find a freelance designer . For most entrepreneurs, hiring a freelance offers the best value for money. You\u2019re not aiming for a prestigious firm, but you\u2019re also ensuring you\u2019re not just paying someone to use a free logo designer and charge you for it. It\u2019s a nice middle of the road option that works out wonderfully for everyone involved. You may be able to find a local logo designer by Googling \u2018logo design\u2019 plus your area. Many logo designers target locally based businesses, and this is an excellent option to connect with someone reliable. Sites like 99designs can help you connect with a designer, but these sites aren\u2019t always ideal. Yet another method is to use portfolio sites like Dribbble Dribbble. You can instantly view hundreds of designers and their work, and you can contact them directly to get a quote. This might take a little longer, but you\u2019ll be happier in the long run. Use an online marketplace . Sites like Upwork Upwork and Fiverr Fiverr are abundant with freelancers, and usually you won\u2019t pay too much. It\u2019s easy to browse the site and find skilled designers, and you can normally get a finished logo in a matter of days. The flip side is that most freelancers on these types of sites will undervalue themselves and charge very little. It\u2019s also somewhat difficult to find designers that don\u2019t produce generic logos. Still, if you pick through the options, you can find some diamonds in the rough. Find a graphic design firm . This is a more expensive option, but it can yield excellent results. If you\u2019re willing to pay up and get a professionally designed logo, you can search for renowned graphic design firms. These firms usually have an in-house team of designers who work to produce the logo of your dreams. These firms are common in major cities, and if you find a local firm, you get the convenience of chatting in person and working with a designer for the best results. For all intents and purposes, your logo is the face of your brand. It\u2019s going to go on all of your marketing materials, so while it might be tough to swallow the idea of spending a few hundred bucks on a logo, keep your eye on the long term. Website Design \u00b6 By now, you should have a sales channel picked out. If you\u2019re going to be using a website of your own, you\u2019ll need to think about your site\u2019s design your site\u2019s design. If you\u2019re using eBay or Amazon, there\u2019s nothing design-related you can do, which limits your ability to effectively brand your business. A website will give you a solid web presence and let you sell however you want to. You know that design is important, but let me ask you a question: How many websites can you remember visiting in the past week? Probably not many. That\u2019s because the average website doesn\u2019t take design seriously. You\u2019ll usually see variations of the same WordPress or Squarespace theme. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with using WordPress or Squarespace, but there is something wrong with having a generic site. You don\u2019t want prospective customers to forget about your site because it looks like any other site out there. Even worse, a lackluster site could kill your conversion rate and turn people away from your site. Website design is another aspect of your business that you should set aside a sizeable budget for. In terms of price, you can spend as little as a few hundred dollars or as much as several thousand. Plan your finances accordingly. Your website is one of the most important business investments most important business investments you\u2019ll make. There are ways of setting up a site yourself, but you\u2019ll get more polished results if you hire a web designer. No matter how you choose to set up your site, you should focus on two important things: Integrating your branding into your site . It\u2019s not called a \u2018brand identity\u2019 for nothing. Your site needs to be an organic extension of your branding. That means the colors, fonts, and images you use should be consistent with your brand. Attention to detail is necessary here because anything that doesn\u2019t align with your brand will feel out of place, and that disrupts the customer experience. Having a memorable design . Your site should look like your site and no one else\u2019s. Despite what you might think, getting a memorable design doesn\u2019t have to dry up your funds. It\u2019s very possible to have a unique design using a website builder like WordPress, but you need to put work into it. Hiring a designer is your best bet if you want your site to be customized to your needs by a pro, but it\u2019s not necessary. There are two routes you can take: build a site yourself or hire someone to do it. There are pros and cons to both, and you need to choose carefully, as a bad website can be a costly mistake. Designing Your Own Site \u00b6 This option is probably the more appealing of the two, right? In theory, you can save tons of money and quickly get a site up that will let you start selling products. Not so fast. This has its perks, and sometimes it\u2019s the preferable option, especially because of the resources that are available to you. At the same time, it\u2019s not the right choice for every dropshipper. It\u2019s crucial to think about what goes into a dropshipping site before you decide to take on the job. Your site will have to have product pages, an integrated payment processor, and encryption, to name just a few things. If there are any bugs in your site, that could spell doom for your business. So if you have zero experience with creating and designing a site, I recommend finding someone experienced to help you out. Yes, it\u2019s an additional cost that you technically could avoid, but paying a bit now can help to save your business in the long run. On the other hand, if you have sufficient web design and/or development experience, this option may be for you. Bear in mind that this will take some time, possibly longer than projects you\u2019ve worked on in the past. It\u2019s tempting to skimp on some details, but don\u2019t. It\u2019s worth mentioning that there are other website solutions to consider. While these won\u2019t give you as much flexibility and customization as a designer would, they\u2019re more affordable and will get the job done. WordPress is one such option. There are numerous ecommerce plugins to help you set up a store even if you\u2019re not the most tech-savvy person in the world. You\u2019ll probably have to pay for some premium (paid) plugins, but the end cost will be much cheaper than seeking out a designer. Squarespace is another popular web design solution. If you go this route, you can utilize Shopify Shopify tools and plugins. These are designed to be incredibly user-friendly and help you step by step through the entire process. Using site builders like WordPress or Squarespace can make the technical stuff easier, but you\u2019ll have to work harder on the design. You don\u2019t want to use the same theme everyone else is using. You could also take a hybrid approach, doing what you can by yourself and hiring someone to do the rest. The upside of using site builders like WordPress is the ability to use the ecommerce plugins I mentioned. There are a plethora of plugins that handle payment processing, storefront design, email lists, and pretty much everything else you can think of. Many dropshippers choose to set up a site like this, and while it works fine, you might find it lacking. In the end, it all depends on what you want from your site. If you\u2019re comfortable and experienced with creating and designing websites, consider the DIY approach. If you want a professional touch, or if you\u2019re not too savvy with website creation, consider hiring someone for the job. Hiring a Web Designer \u00b6 Because the success of your entire business depends upon your site operating flawlessly, hiring a web designer is an excellent choice in most cases. It\u2019s a long term investment, and while it may hurt your wallet now, it will pay for itself in due time. The options for finding a web designer are the same as finding a logo designer. You can reach out to your network, find a freelancer online, or work with a design firm. However, since web design can cost a pretty penny, you\u2019ll want to put even more thought and research into finding the perfect web designer. It\u2019s always a good idea to chat with the designer if possible and see if he or she is on the same page as you and understands your vision. As I mentioned in the logo design section, fraudulent designers can be an issue. Many \u2018designers\u2019 just set up a WordPress site and charge a premium fee for it. If you don\u2019t even know how to use WordPress, this isn\u2019t a bad option, but the point is that you need to do your homework before paying anybody. Make sure you\u2019re clear on what a designer will do for you. A good web designer will be able to answer your questions, integrate your branding, and showcase work they\u2019ve done in the past. Ideally you want a designer who has created retail sites before. Since online stores require more work than other sites, it\u2019s important you work with someone who\u2019s used to it. A designer who\u2019s unfamiliar with how ecommerce stores work could end up creating a site that\u2019s not exactly optimized for converting and selling. If you think you\u2019ve found the right designer for you, you might want to email the people or businesses they\u2019ve worked with before. Getting honest, personal testimonials can speak volumes about a designer\u2019s quality. At the very least, check out previous sites the designer has done and take a thorough look at them. Are they visually and functionally similar to what you\u2019re looking for? Now for the big question: how much should you expect to spend? This is where the costs can add up. An ecommerce site starts at around $5,000 and goes up from there. If this seems like a lot, refocus on the big picture. While it\u2019s tempting to cut costs by doing things yourself, paying a designer is usually worth it because it provides you with peace of mind. You\u2019ll have a storefront that works flawlessly in a short amount of time, which means you\u2019ll be able to start selling sooner. The final product will be refined and visually appealing, so you won\u2019t have to worry about having a subpar site. Whether you design the site yourself or outsource the job, you\u2019ll want to get familiar with how the site runs. This is especially true for ecommerce plugins. Since you\u2019ll be using a suite of plugins, spend some time with them and get used to how they work. If you run into problems, you\u2019ll want to be able to troubleshoot easily. Copywriting \u00b6 Whether you end up building your own website or not, you\u2019ll still need professional copywriting. Writing is an essential part of a site that most people overlook. Many entrepreneurs focus on having a flashy site or an eye-catching logo, but they forget about the writing. Good copywriting Good copywriting is vital for several aspects of a dropshipping business: Ad copy Product descriptions Marketing content Social media posts Additional content (e.g., blog posts, videos, guides) In short, writing is a huge part of how you\u2019ll convert people and close the sale. The right words can bring your brand to life and turn one-time shoppers into repeat customers. On the other hand, boring copy can make your visitors click away and possibly never visit your site again. Writers are a dime a dozen these days, so you have to be careful when selecting someone to work with. You don\u2019t necessarily need someone who has a master\u2019s degree in English, but you shouldn\u2019t work with someone whose work is riddled with errors. Even small grammar issues can make visitors feel like you don\u2019t care or that you\u2019re lazy, and that\u2019s the last thing you want. If you want to grab your audience\u2019s attention, you\u2019ll need cleanly edited, emotionally engaging copy. That means you\u2019ll want to find a seasoned writer who also knows the ins and outs of sales copy, marketing content, product descriptions and product descriptions. There\u2019s a world of difference between writing a book and website copy that converts, so the writer you choose should have prior experience in copywriting for online businesses. Again, you can find a freelancer, use an online marketplace, or work with a firm. Although I should note that when it comes to writing, it\u2019s often very difficult to pick through online marketplaces (like Upwork) to find high quality writers. Many writers aren\u2019t native speakers of the languages they list, and once you filter those writers out, you\u2019ll still find many who don\u2019t have the requirements you need. But before you even start your search for a writer, you have to know what tone of voice you\u2019re going for. If your brand is casual or even edgy, you won\u2019t want formal or poetic copy. Likewise, if you\u2019re going for a super-professional appearance, you won\u2019t want your copy to be filled with slang. Again, check out some of your competitors and evaluate them. Which writing styles do you like? Communicating that to your writer will help them understand what you\u2019re looking for. You should also consider whether you want to find a writer to work with in the long term. Since you\u2019ll regularly need new ad copy for products and marketing materials, it may benefit you to find a perfect writer from the start and build a working relationship. This can save you time down the road since you won\u2019t have to look for a writer all over again. All of that being said, finding a good freelance writer can still be tricky, especially if you\u2019ve never worked with a writer before. Finding someone with an established portfolio is usually your best bet. Remember that just like logo and web design, writing takes a lot of work, so it\u2019s not going to be cheap. While writing rates are variable, expect to pay the equivalent of 10 cents per word or higher to get the good stuff. Some writers charge hourly or per project, so you\u2019d have to figure out the per word equivalent. If you\u2019re in a smaller or more technically demanding niche, you\u2019ll need to pay even more to find someone who is experienced in the field. The bottom line is that for premium, professional writing, you\u2019ll need to budget accordingly. Maintaining Your Brand \u00b6 Once you\u2019ve worked on both your internal and external branding for a while, you should have a solid sense of your brand as a whole. A lasting brand will require development, so tweak it from time to time. For example, if you notice your customers using a certain tone of voice, you might want to emulate that with your copy. As your store grows, your brand will too. If you keep focusing on improving your brand improving your brand, you\u2019ll have a dropshipping business that attracts customers in droves and keeps them coming back for more.","title":"Branding"},{"location":"en/ch08/#branding","text":"Dropshipping 101: Ecommerce Without Inventory | Branding Chapter 8 by Daniel Threlfall 30 Jun, 2020 So far, you\u2019ve started to build the foundation of your business. I\u2019ve gone over a lot of the brass tacks, from niche selection to incorporation. You\u2019ve come a long way, but there\u2019s still some important steps ahead. Even though I\u2019ve talked about building your business, a business isn\u2019t truly a complete business without a unique identity. That\u2019s where branding comes in That\u2019s where branding comes in. The right branding can establish your business as a trustworthy retailer and help with marketing too. It\u2019s what helps certain retailers rise above the others and stick in customers\u2019 minds. Think of your favorite company. You probably know their logo, the tone of voice they use for advertisements, and maybe even their slogan. These elements are important for a memorable brand, and to really stand out, you\u2019ll need to put some serious work into developing a robust brand. Many dropshipping stores don\u2019t have a brand. Think of all of the online storefronts that look the same. They\u2019re interchangeable. They give you no compelling reason to buy from them. Building a brand takes effort, and some dropshipping stores are only out to make fast cash. That\u2019s why so many dropshippers offer rock bottom prices. Nevertheless, a brand is crucial. Customers know a good brand when they see one. The best companies in the world have awesome brands, so why shouldn\u2019t your store have one? However, the concept of branding can be a little confusing or vague. What exactly goes into a brand? What\u2019s the process behind branding? As a whole, branding far exceeds the scope of this guide, but I\u2019ll get into the basics to get you started. First I\u2019ll define what a brand is, and then I\u2019ll show you what you need to focus on to brand your business.","title":"Branding"},{"location":"en/ch08/#what-is-branding","text":"You know that every company has a brand, something that makes each business unique something that makes each business unique. So a brand is essentially a company\u2019s identity. Just like no two people are alike, no two businesses are alike, and brands are what make them all different. If you want, you can think of a brand as a company\u2019s personality. A brand tells your customers who you are and what you\u2019re about. It\u2019s the essence of your business essence of your business \u2013 the who, what, and why, so to speak. Lots of companies treat branding as an afterthought. If you go that route, you\u2019ll find it difficult to gain traction and get new customers. Without a brand, your business won\u2019t be memorable, and it won\u2019t make prospective customers think it\u2019s special. This is the reason why a lot of first time dropshippers give up and quit. They don\u2019t spend enough time on branding. Branding is the thread that runs through your entire business. Everything about your business should be infused with your brand. Your social media, marketing strategies, and even ad copy will all reflect your brand. Branding is both internal and external. Internal branding deals with your mission statement and company values, while external branding deals with aspects like design and copy. Also, branding is part of the value you provide to your audience. Whether or not your customers are loyal will largely depend on how much your brand resonates with them. A remarkable brand will attract customers by connecting with them and help turn casual shoppers into loyal followers. First, let\u2019s discuss internal branding","title":"What Is Branding?"},{"location":"en/ch08/#internal-branding","text":"Whether you\u2019re a solopreneur or the head of a small team, your company needs internal branding. This may seem insignificant, but I urge you to not ignore it. internal branding Image source Internal branding Internal branding allows you (and any team members you have) to understand what your company stands for. It\u2019s another way of saying your company is focused on its customers. And while your customers aren\u2019t ever going to see what your internal branding is like, your public presence will reflect the attitude you maintain. A good internal brand ensures everyone is on the same page and facilitates an optimal work ethic. Two common ways of implementing internal branding are the mission statement and a list of values.","title":"Internal Branding"},{"location":"en/ch08/#creating-a-mission-statement","text":"Throughout this book, I\u2019ve placed a heavy emphasis on value. By now, I hope you\u2019ve gained a value-first mindset that focuses on how you can best serve your audience. This idea of value first is integral to a successful mission statement. Mission statements can sometimes seem corny or disingenuous, but a good mission statement can work wonders for your business by giving you a customer-centric perspective. You\u2019ve probably seen lots of mission statements before, but if you haven\u2019t, here are some famous examples here are some famous examples: Warby Parker : \u201cTo offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially-conscious businesses.\u201d Nordstrom : \u201cTo give customers the most compelling shopping experience possible.\u201d JetBlue : \u201cTo inspire humanity \u2013 both in the air and on the ground.\u201d These mission statements are more than hollow platitudes to whip up some good PR. They\u2019re designed to guide each and every worker in everything he or she does. A good mission statement improves morale, creates a positive environment, and helps everyone communicate better. To see the power of the mission statement in action, take a second look at those mission statements above. They\u2019re all about what the company does for the customer. This is vital because if your mission statement is all about your company, it\u2019s not going to work well. Just like you\u2019ve developed a value-first mindset, you have to develop a value-first mission statement. Again, this may seem like overkill for a dropshipping business, but trust me \u2013 not many dropshippers take this seriously. It may not always be obvious, but most successful dropshippers with great brands have an outstanding mission statement that\u2019s driving them. This is how companies like IKEA work. You may not realize it at first, but IKEA\u2019s goal of helping more people can create a better everyday life at home affects everything they do affects everything they do, from product design to store layout. This is exactly the kind of internal structure you want to create for your dropshipping business (even if it\u2019s just you right now). It\u2019s also important to establish your internal branding before you start working on any external branding. It\u2019s like building a house on a sturdy foundation. Your external branding is the house, and your internal branding is the foundation. Not an expert on crafting inspirational mission statements? Don\u2019t worry. Here are a few tips to give you a boost. Don\u2019t make your mission statement self-serving . Like I said, you have to put your customer base first, and that means refraining from overloading your mission statement with \u2018we\u2019. Yes, your mission statement is about your company, but only about what your company can offer. Don\u2019t get too caught up in your ambition and lose sight of that. Think in verbs . The mission statements listed above all start with \u201cto ____\u201d. To offer, to give, to inspire. These are all verbs, and who is the recipient of these actions? The customer. If you think of what your company does in terms of verbs, it\u2019s easier to maintain the focus on your customers and not yourself. Reflect on why your company does what it does . Every company needs a fundamental reason to exist, often simply called a \u2018why\u2019. If your why is just to sell and make money, that\u2019s not good. Your business needs to have a reason to improve people\u2019s lives somehow. You then need to incorporate that reason into your mission statement. Warby Parker\u2019s mission statement does this wonderfully: \u201cTo offer designer eyewear at a revolutionary price, while leading the way for socially-conscious businesses.\u201d You\u2019ll want to draft several mission statements, anywhere from 10-30. It\u2019s okay if they don\u2019t sound perfect. Right now, you want to think of as many statements as possible to give you the most options to work with. Next, narrow it down. Which mission statements summarize your goals best? Which ones would you identify with most if you were the customer? You might need to change your mission statement over time. As your business grows, you\u2019ll get a better idea of the value you provide and what your specific objectives are.

If you can\u2019t find anyone through your network, there are tons of sites that allow you to get a well designed logo that doesn\u2019t put you in debt. Here are a few options. Find a freelance designer . For most entrepreneurs, hiring a freelance offers the best value for money. You\u2019re not aiming for a prestigious firm, but you\u2019re also ensuring you\u2019re not just paying someone to use a free logo designer and charge you for it. It\u2019s a nice middle of the road option that works out wonderfully for everyone involved. You may be able to find a local logo designer by Googling \u2018logo design\u2019 plus your area. Many logo designers target locally based businesses, and this is an excellent option to connect with someone reliable. Sites like 99designs can help you connect with a designer, but these sites aren\u2019t always ideal. Yet another method is to use portfolio sites like Dribbble Dribbble. You can instantly view hundreds of designers and their work, and you can contact them directly to get a quote. This might take a little longer, but you\u2019ll be happier in the long run. Use an online marketplace . Sites like Upwork Upwork and Fiverr Fiverr are abundant with freelancers, and usually you won\u2019t pay too much. It\u2019s easy to browse the site and find skilled designers, and you can normally get a finished logo in a matter of days. The flip side is that most freelancers on these types of sites will undervalue themselves and charge very little. It\u2019s also somewhat difficult to find designers that don\u2019t produce generic logos. Still, if you pick through the options, you can find some diamonds in the rough. Find a graphic design firm . This is a more expensive option, but it can yield excellent results. If you\u2019re willing to pay up and get a professionally designed logo, you can search for renowned graphic design firms. These firms usually have an in-house team of designers who work to produce the logo of your dreams. These firms are common in major cities, and if you find a local firm, you get the convenience of chatting in person and working with a designer for the best results. For all intents and purposes, your logo is the face of your brand. It\u2019s going to go on all of your marketing materials, so while it might be tough to swallow the idea of spending a few hundred bucks on a logo, keep your eye on the long term.","title":"Logo Design"},{"location":"en/ch08/#website-design","text":"By now, you should have a sales channel picked out. If you\u2019re going to be using a website of your own, you\u2019ll need to think about your site\u2019s design your site\u2019s design. If you\u2019re using eBay or Amazon, there\u2019s nothing design-related you can do, which limits your ability to effectively brand your business. A website will give you a solid web presence and let you sell however you want to. You know that design is important, but let me ask you a question: How many websites can you remember visiting in the past week? Probably not many. That\u2019s because the average website doesn\u2019t take design seriously. You\u2019ll usually see variations of the same WordPress or Squarespace theme. Now, there\u2019s nothing wrong with using WordPress or Squarespace, but there is something wrong with having a generic site. You don\u2019t want prospective customers to forget about your site because it looks like any other site out there. Even worse, a lackluster site could kill your conversion rate and turn people away from your site. Website design is another aspect of your business that you should set aside a sizeable budget for. In terms of price, you can spend as little as a few hundred dollars or as much as several thousand. Plan your finances accordingly. Your website is one of the most important business investments most important business investments you\u2019ll make. There are ways of setting up a site yourself, but you\u2019ll get more polished results if you hire a web designer. No matter how you choose to set up your site, you should focus on two important things: Integrating your branding into your site . It\u2019s not called a \u2018brand identity\u2019 for nothing. Your site needs to be an organic extension of your branding. That means the colors, fonts, and images you use should be consistent with your brand. Attention to detail is necessary here because anything that doesn\u2019t align with your brand will feel out of place, and that disrupts the customer experience. Having a memorable design . Your site should look like your site and no one else\u2019s. Despite what you might think, getting a memorable design doesn\u2019t have to dry up your funds. It\u2019s very possible to have a unique design using a website builder like WordPress, but you need to put work into it. Hiring a designer is your best bet if you want your site to be customized to your needs by a pro, but it\u2019s not necessary. There are two routes you can take: build a site yourself or hire someone to do it. There are pros and cons to both, and you need to choose carefully, as a bad website can be a costly mistake.","title":"Website Design"},{"location":"en/ch08/#designing-your-own-site","text":"This option is probably the more appealing of the two, right? In theory, you can save tons of money and quickly get a site up that will let you start selling products. Not so fast. This has its perks, and sometimes it\u2019s the preferable option, especially because of the resources that are available to you. At the same time, it\u2019s not the right choice for every dropshipper. It\u2019s crucial to think about what goes into a dropshipping site before you decide to take on the job. Your site will have to have product pages, an integrated payment processor, and encryption, to name just a few things. If there are any bugs in your site, that could spell doom for your business. So if you have zero experience with creating and designing a site, I recommend finding someone experienced to help you out. Yes, it\u2019s an additional cost that you technically could avoid, but paying a bit now can help to save your business in the long run. On the other hand, if you have sufficient web design and/or development experience, this option may be for you. Bear in mind that this will take some time, possibly longer than projects you\u2019ve worked on in the past. It\u2019s tempting to skimp on some details, but don\u2019t. It\u2019s worth mentioning that there are other website solutions to consider. While these won\u2019t give you as much flexibility and customization as a designer would, they\u2019re more affordable and will get the job done. WordPress is one such option. There are numerous ecommerce plugins to help you set up a store even if you\u2019re not the most tech-savvy person in the world. You\u2019ll probably have to pay for some premium (paid) plugins, but the end cost will be much cheaper than seeking out a designer. Squarespace is another popular web design solution. If you go this route, you can utilize Shopify Shopify tools and plugins. These are designed to be incredibly user-friendly and help you step by step through the entire process. Using site builders like WordPress or Squarespace can make the technical stuff easier, but you\u2019ll have to work harder on the design. You don\u2019t want to use the same theme everyone else is using. You could also take a hybrid approach, doing what you can by yourself and hiring someone to do the rest. The upside of using site builders like WordPress is the ability to use the ecommerce plugins I mentioned. There are a plethora of plugins that handle payment processing, storefront design, email lists, and pretty much everything else you can think of. Many dropshippers choose to set up a site like this, and while it works fine, you might find it lacking. In the end, it all depends on what you want from your site. If you\u2019re comfortable and experienced with creating and designing websites, consider the DIY approach. If you want a professional touch, or if you\u2019re not too savvy with website creation, consider hiring someone for the job.","title":"Designing Your Own Site"},{"location":"en/ch08/#hiring-a-web-designer","text":"Because the success of your entire business depends upon your site operating flawlessly, hiring a web designer is an excellent choice in most cases. It\u2019s a long term investment, and while it may hurt your wallet now, it will pay for itself in due time. The options for finding a web designer are the same as finding a logo designer. You can reach out to your network, find a freelancer online, or work with a design firm. However, since web design can cost a pretty penny, you\u2019ll want to put even more thought and research into finding the perfect web designer. It\u2019s always a good idea to chat with the designer if possible and see if he or she is on the same page as you and understands your vision. As I mentioned in the logo design section, fraudulent designers can be an issue. Many \u2018designers\u2019 just set up a WordPress site and charge a premium fee for it. If you don\u2019t even know how to use WordPress, this isn\u2019t a bad option, but the point is that you need to do your homework before paying anybody. Make sure you\u2019re clear on what a designer will do for you. A good web designer will be able to answer your questions, integrate your branding, and showcase work they\u2019ve done in the past. Ideally you want a designer who has created retail sites before. Since online stores require more work than other sites, it\u2019s important you work with someone who\u2019s used to it. A designer who\u2019s unfamiliar with how ecommerce stores work could end up creating a site that\u2019s not exactly optimized for converting and selling. If you think you\u2019ve found the right designer for you, you might want to email the people or businesses they\u2019ve worked with before. Getting honest, personal testimonials can speak volumes about a designer\u2019s quality. At the very least, check out previous sites the designer has done and take a thorough look at them. Are they visually and functionally similar to what you\u2019re looking for? Now for the big question: how much should you expect to spend? This is where the costs can add up. An ecommerce site starts at around $5,000 and goes up from there. If this seems like a lot, refocus on the big picture. While it\u2019s tempting to cut costs by doing things yourself, paying a designer is usually worth it because it provides you with peace of mind. You\u2019ll have a storefront that works flawlessly in a short amount of time, which means you\u2019ll be able to start selling sooner. The final product will be refined and visually appealing, so you won\u2019t have to worry about having a subpar site. Whether you design the site yourself or outsource the job, you\u2019ll want to get familiar with how the site runs. This is especially true for ecommerce plugins. Since you\u2019ll be using a suite of plugins, spend some time with them and get used to how they work. If you run into problems, you\u2019ll want to be able to troubleshoot easily.","title":"Hiring a Web Designer"},{"location":"en/ch08/#copywriting","text":"Whether you end up building your own website or not, you\u2019ll still need professional copywriting. Writing is an essential part of a site that most people overlook. Many entrepreneurs focus on having a flashy site or an eye-catching logo, but they forget about the writing. Good copywriting Good copywriting is vital for several aspects of a dropshipping business: Ad copy Product descriptions Marketing content Social media posts Additional content (e.g., blog posts, videos, guides) In short, writing is a huge part of how you\u2019ll convert people and close the sale. The right words can bring your brand to life and turn one-time shoppers into repeat customers. On the other hand, boring copy can make your visitors click away and possibly never visit your site again. Writers are a dime a dozen these days, so you have to be careful when selecting someone to work with. You don\u2019t necessarily need someone who has a master\u2019s degree in English, but you shouldn\u2019t work with someone whose work is riddled with errors. Even small grammar issues can make visitors feel like you don\u2019t care or that you\u2019re lazy, and that\u2019s the last thing you want. If you want to grab your audience\u2019s attention, you\u2019ll need cleanly edited, emotionally engaging copy. That means you\u2019ll want to find a seasoned writer who also knows the ins and outs of sales copy, marketing content, product descriptions and product descriptions. There\u2019s a world of difference between writing a book and website copy that converts, so the writer you choose should have prior experience in copywriting for online businesses. Again, you can find a freelancer, use an online marketplace, or work with a firm. Although I should note that when it comes to writing, it\u2019s often very difficult to pick through online marketplaces (like Upwork) to find high quality writers. Many writers aren\u2019t native speakers of the languages they list, and once you filter those writers out, you\u2019ll still find many who don\u2019t have the requirements you need. But before you even start your search for a writer, you have to know what tone of voice you\u2019re going for. If your brand is casual or even edgy, you won\u2019t want formal or poetic copy. Likewise, if you\u2019re going for a super-professional appearance, you won\u2019t want your copy to be filled with slang. Again, check out some of your competitors and evaluate them. Which writing styles do you like? Communicating that to your writer will help them understand what you\u2019re looking for. You should also consider whether you want to find a writer to work with in the long term. Since you\u2019ll regularly need new ad copy for products and marketing materials, it may benefit you to find a perfect writer from the start and build a working relationship. This can save you time down the road since you won\u2019t have to look for a writer all over again. All of that being said, finding a good freelance writer can still be tricky, especially if you\u2019ve never worked with a writer before. Finding someone with an established portfolio is usually your best bet. Remember that just like logo and web design, writing takes a lot of work, so it\u2019s not going to be cheap. While writing rates are variable, expect to pay the equivalent of 10 cents per word or higher to get the good stuff. Some writers charge hourly or per project, so you\u2019d have to figure out the per word equivalent. If you\u2019re in a smaller or more technically demanding niche, you\u2019ll need to pay even more to find someone who is experienced in the field. The bottom line is that for premium, professional writing, you\u2019ll need to budget accordingly.","title":"Copywriting"},{"location":"en/ch08/#maintaining-your-brand","text":"Once you\u2019ve worked on both your internal and external branding for a while, you should have a solid sense of your brand as a whole.

As your store grows, your brand will too.

Now that you\u2019ve built up your business and understand your place in the market, you can work on building relationships with suppliers to get the actual products to sell. In this chapter, I\u2019ll give you a primer on how to find and contact suppliers. I\u2019ll also go over some common pitfalls that first-time dropshippers often make when looking for suppliers to work with. Finding Suppliers \u00b6 Finding the right suppliers takes some caution, so it\u2019s crucial to use the right strategies. With a little bit of work, you\u2019ll be able to separate the good from the bad and find reliable wholesalers to do business with. Some of these strategies are more effective than others, so I\u2019ll start with the one that\u2019s worked the best for me and then work my way down the list. Contact the Product Manufacturer \u00b6 This is by far the easiest and most effective method of finding wholesalers. Once you know which products you want to sell, find out who makes those products and contact them. Ask them for their list of wholesale distributors. This gives you an official list from the manufacturer themselves, so you know you\u2019ll be working with legitimate businesses. This strategy is quick and only takes a few calls. By calling different manufacturers in your niche, you might find the same wholesalers coming up again and again. This lets you know who the leading wholesalers are, and you barely have to do any work to find out. Use Oberlo \u00b6 If you want to be able to easily find and even switch between different suppliers, give Oberlo a look. Oberlo integrates seamlessly integrates seamlessly with Shopify and makes supplier management a breeze. You\u2019ll have access to a vast catalog of products, from thousands of suppliers. In addition, you\u2019ll get access to several other handy features. You can import products directly from suppliers, fulfill orders automatically, automate your prices, and more. Here\u2019s a full list of Oberlo\u2019s features Here\u2019s a full list of Oberlo\u2019s features. Use Supplier Directories \u00b6 I mentioned supplier directories earlier in connection with fees. No supplier will charge a monthly fee, but a supplier directory might. Supplier directories list wholesalers in all kinds of niches. There are two main benefits to directories: security and convenience. Directories are secure because they often screen wholesalers before listing them, and they\u2019re convenient because you can look up wholesalers by niche or product type. It can save you a lot of time when you\u2019re searching for suppliers. By no means are supplier directories necessary. They make your job easier if you have the money to spend on them, but you can find all of the legitimate wholesalers you need without ever touching a directory. All in all, directories are great for some dropshippers, but not for everyone. If you want to save some time and don\u2019t mind paying the price of admission, here are some of the most trusted and well-known directories. I\u2019m not endorsing or advertising for any of these. I just want you to know what your options are. Worldwide Brands Worldwide Brands \u2013 This is one of the oldest and most trustworthy supplier directories. Created in 1999, Worldwide Brands has a huge database of thousands of certified wholesalers. These wholesalers are all top-level, meaning they\u2019re not middlemen (i.e., the retailers who pretend to be wholesalers). If that\u2019s not enough, you can also browse over 10 million products. The cost is $299 for a lifetime membership, which is a great deal compared to many of the directories out there. If you\u2019re planning to rely heavily on a directory and you want one of the best, Worldwide Brands is definitely worth a look. Wholesale Central Wholesale Central \u2013 Wholesale Central is completely free. This might seem like a warning sign at first, and it\u2019s true that this directory has some issues. Even though Wholesale Central charges a listing fee to suppliers, not every listing is genuine. For one, most of the \u2018wholesalers seem to be retailers selling at \u2018wholesale\u2019 prices. Wholesale Central also claims to screen its applicants, but they don\u2019t specify what that process looks like, so it\u2019s very possible that some illegitimate suppliers are slipping through the cracks. Bottom line \u2013 feel free to browse it, but be cautious and do a lot of research before reaching out. How to Spot Fake Wholesalers \u00b6 Now that you know how to find suppliers, I\u2019m going to show you how to identify fake dropshipping suppliers. That\u2019s right \u2013 there are fakes out there. Some retail stores pose as wholesale suppliers so they can sell more, but they mark up the prices like crazy. You want to work with true wholesalers who buy directly from the manufacturer and can offer you much better pricing. If you go and look for wholesalers, it might be difficult to tell which ones are fake. In fact, it might be nearly impossible. That\u2019s because the fake ones often seem more credible. Unfortunately, legitimate wholesalers tend to be less marketing-savvy, so it\u2019s often more difficult to find them. Fake suppliers, on the other hand, often excel at marketing, so they\u2019ll pop up a lot when you search. There are a few telltale signs that give away fake dropshipping wholesalers: They sell products to the general public . Many retailers posing as wholesalers will sell to the public, often advertising \u2018wholesale prices\u2019 to make customers think they\u2019re getting a good deal. What they\u2019re really doing is selling products at inflated prices and then slapping the wholesale label on them. This is a dead giveaway that you\u2019re not dealing with a legitimate wholesaler. If you see a wholesaler listing their prices publicly, this is also a sign they\u2019re fake. A real wholesaler will never sell to the public. Furthermore, in order to make a deal with a wholesaler, you\u2019ll have to apply and be approved. Wholesalers won\u2019t work with just anybody. You have to prove you own your business and that it\u2019s a legitimate business. They charge ongoing fees . This is another way for fake suppliers to squeeze more money out of their unsuspecting victims. They\u2019ll charge a monthly fee just for doing business with them. No true wholesaler would ever do this. However, you might come across some wholesaler directories that may charge a fee. These directories are actually a good method of finding suppliers, so I\u2019ll discuss them shortly. Just be aware that a supplier will not ask for a base fee of any sort. They don\u2019t want to sign any contracts . This is a huge red flag. You will always need to sign a contract to enter into a legally binding business agreement before making any purchases. A supplier that refuses to sign a contract (or says it\u2019s not necessary) is fake. How to Spot Legitimate Wholesalers \u00b6 So how do you find legitimate wholesalers to work with? Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t have to be a guessing game. Real wholesalers can be detected using a few simple criteria: They require you to apply . Whereas fake wholesalers won\u2019t have an application process, legitimate wholesalers will. You\u2019ll have to be legally incorporated, and the supplier will have to approve you. All of this will happen before you even see any prices. They have a minimum order size . It\u2019s common for suppliers to have a minimum order size, especially for your first order. This is because suppliers only want to work with serious businesses, so setting a minimum order size helps to filter out people who are just window shopping. Sometimes this can be problematic for dropshippers. Consider the following scenario. A supplier has a $500 minimum order, but the size of your average order is only $75. In this case, it seems like you\u2019d have to pay the $500 just to open the dropshipping account in the first place. What do you do? My advice is to turn the extra amount into credit to be applied to future orders. This way, you\u2019re meeting the minimum order size, but you don\u2019t have to order extra product. They have experienced staff and a dedicated support team . This is truly a hallmark of a top-notch supplier. You should be able to call up a representative who knows your niche and can answer any questions you have in detail. If the company reps don\u2019t seem knowledgeable, it\u2019s possible they were hired without any experience or training. On top of that, look out for a dedicated support team. If you\u2019re working with a wholesaler, you should be assigned one specific customer support member to take care of your needs. This will make problem solving easy. Having to call and email multiple team members only leads to confusion, and it makes problems worse. That\u2019s why having a single point of contact is so beneficial. Their technology is up-to-date . Remember when I said that legitimate wholesalers tend to be bad at marketing? Unfortunately, they also tend to be bad with technology as a whole. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it sure helps when your supplier has a polished website and interface. Being able to use features like real-time inventory, searchable order histories, and easy-to-use online catalogs are incredibly useful and save you lots of time. They have pre-order fees . While no retailer will charge monthly fees, many will charge small pre-order fees. These usually range from $1 to $5 per order or possibly more, depending on how large the order is. These fees cover the costs of packaging and shipping, since individual orders carry much higher fees than bulk orders do. They won\u2019t go over the top to persuade you to work with them . This is a tactic you\u2019ll see a lot with middlemen \u2018wholesalers\u2019. Since these businesses are just retailers, they\u2019re going to use sales tactics to try to get your money. They\u2019ll go on about their benefits and provide lots of information that\u2019s really useless. Real wholesalers won\u2019t bend over backward to work with you. They\u2019ll require you to apply, and they\u2019ll have stringent requirements. If a \u2018wholesaler\u2019 is throwing sales pitch after sales pitch at you, run for the hills. What to Look for in a Supplier \u00b6 Just because a certain supplier is legitimate, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the best option for you. Choosing the right suppliers can be a lengthy process, but it\u2019ll be worth it when you find one that ticks all of the boxes you need. To do that, you need to know how to spot a good supplier. If you\u2019re new to searching for suppliers, you may not even know where to start analyzing the quality of one supplier over another. Fear not, because I have some expert tips for you. It might not be obvious to look for these things, but they can save you insane amounts of time and money. They take orders by email . Having to call in an order instead of emailing may seem like a minor issue that you shouldn\u2019t raise a stink about. But think about a future where you\u2019re getting hundreds of orders every day. Do you want to have to call in all those orders (or hire someone to do it for you)? Even placing orders via the supplier\u2019s website can be time consuming. Being able to submit orders through email will be a blessing when you\u2019re getting inundated with new orders every hour. Thankfully, many wholesalers will accept email orders, but there are some who use other systems. Their location is prime for shipping . Assuming you\u2019re in the United States, think about where the best location for a supplier is. If the supplier only has one shipping center, it\u2019s makes the most sense for it to be in the middle of the country. This allows packages to get to 90% of the US in 2-4 business days. If the supplier is on either coast or perhaps far south, it can take more than a week for some orders to get in customers\u2019 hands. A centrally located supplier will give you consistent shipping results, and on average it will only take a few days for people to get their items. International shipping is a whole different ball game, of course, but for domestic shipping, a central location is ideal. Their processes are efficient . Obviously you don\u2019t want to work with suppliers who constantly botch orders or make mistakes. But how can you know that without actually working with them? Unfortunately, you really can\u2019t. What you can do is place a few test orders. This won\u2019t conclusively prove the supplier\u2019s quality, but it will give you some helpful information. You can see what the order process looks like from your side, how long the shipping takes, and how the items arrive. For example, if the supplier doesn\u2019t send out tracking information within a few days, that could be a red flag. The entire process should be smooth and seamless, from the order to the delivery. Getting Ready to Contact Suppliers \u00b6 After you\u2019ve compiled a list of suppliers you\u2019d like to contact, you\u2019ll need to take care of a few more things before you actually reach out. It\u2019s easiest to interact with suppliers once you have the necessary legal standing and know exactly what you\u2019re looking for in a supplier. Be Incorporated \u00b6 This is a must. As I said earlier, most wholesalers will require proof that your business is indeed legal, and that means incorporation. In fact, the majority of wholesalers will only show their pricing to approved businesses, so unless you\u2019re incorporated unless you\u2019re incorporated, you probably won\u2019t even see wholesale prices. Know What You Want \u00b6 What do you want from your dropshipper? What products do you want to offer? These are the types of questions you\u2019ll want to answer before talking to a supplier. Basically, you\u2019ll want to have all the specifics in mind before you make contact. (The section above about knowing what to look for should also help you with this.) Wholesalers are there to do business, and they get tons of spam every day from people who waste their time. You don\u2019t want to be one of those people. You need to show them you mean business, and a lot of that proof comes with how you present yourself. If you get straight to the point and don\u2019t ask a million questions, the supplier will know you\u2019re serious. So it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re looking for well before you ever pick up the phone or type an email. Try to take up as little of their time as possible (but don\u2019t be afraid to ask legitimate questions). Ask If They Dropship \u00b6 Not all wholesalers offer dropshipping, so this is probably the #1 question you\u2019ll want to ask. You might already know, but it\u2019s still polite to ask (and it gets you and the rep on the same page). You don\u2019t want to chat on the phone with a supplier for half an hour about products and pricing only to learn that they don\u2019t dropship. If a specific supplier doesn\u2019t dropship but you definitely want to go with them, let them know that, and see if you can negotiate a deal. This is the exception rather than the rule, but it\u2019s not unheard of. The Phone Is Your Friend \u00b6 These days, the average entrepreneur\u2019s first instinct is to type up a quick email and shoot it off. Email has become the go-to method of communication for many people. On top of that, fear of talking on the phone is very common, even for entrepreneurs. It\u2019s easy to understand why. It\u2019s intimidating to place your first call (or even your first ten calls) to suppliers you\u2019ve never talked to before. dropshipping suppliers Image source But once you pick up the phone for the first time and start talking, it gets a lot less scary. It\u2019s not as bad as it seems, and even if communication isn\u2019t your strong suit, don\u2019t worry; suppliers are used to it, and they\u2019re there to help you. One effective phone call can do the work of fifty emails, so you\u2019ll zip right along instead of waiting days for a response in your inbox. Simply calling instead of emailing can save you months of wasted time. Still afraid? Here\u2019s a tip \u2013 write out your questions before you make the call. This way, you\u2019ll have a structure to your conversation. Believe it or not, this little technique can make all the difference. Paying Suppliers \u00b6 So you\u2019ve hunted down a great supplier, chatted on the phone, sealed the deal, and are ready to join forces. You should be aware of how suppliers will take payment so there will be no hitches when it comes time to pay. Credit card . In Chapter 6 Chapter 6, I recommended getting a credit card exclusively for business use, and this is one of the biggest reasons to do so. Nearly every wholesaler will accept credit card payment, and it\u2019s easily the most convenient way to pay. The nice thing is that you\u2019ll have few out-of-pocket expenses because you\u2019ll be paying the supplier for orders that customers have already placed. This makes it super easy to rack up lots of rewards and/or frequent flier miles. Credit cards are also fast and secure. Many suppliers will have your CC number on file and simply charge you when you place an order, which makes the process straightforward and painless. PayPal . While not every supplier will accept PayPal, many do since it\u2019s become so ubiquitous. This is also an extremely convenient way to pay, but there are always fees when dealing with PayPal, which is why it\u2019s not always the best choice. Generally speaking, a credit card is better, but there are some situations in which PayPal might win out. You\u2019ll have to research both options and see which one is right for you. If you\u2019re in doubt, go with a credit card. You can get tons of rewards and bypass the hefty fees PayPal charges. Net terms . This is a more traditional method of paying suppliers, but it\u2019s still widely in use today. Under a net terms arrangement, after you purchase products you have a certain number of days to pay, usually by check or bank transfer. For example, if you\u2019re on \u2018Net 30\u2019 terms, you have 30 days after you place the order to pay. You\u2019re probably asking yourself why suppliers use this payment method if they don\u2019t get the money upfront. Couldn\u2019t someone run away with the product? Suppliers solve this problem by requiring credit references. If your chosen supplier uses net terms, you\u2019ll need to provide some relevant documentation when you apply for an account. Dealing with Suppliers \u00b6 You might be wondering what your responsibilities are when dealing with a supplier, or maybe you want to know what the retailer-supplier relationship looks like. While this varies from supplier to supplier, there are some general rules of thumb to keep in mind when you\u2019re preparing to start working with a supplier. Be timely with sending in orders . This is vital not only for your supplier but also for your customers. You need to get your customers\u2019 orders from point A (your site) to point B (the supplier) in a speedy fashion. Depending on how many sales you get, this could mean processing orders daily or, if you\u2019re selling like crazy, outsourcing the job to a virtual assistant. Get to know your contact/representative . As I briefly mentioned earlier in this chapter, a good supplier will assign you a dedicated representative. You\u2019ll want to build good rapport with this person, since he or she will be providing help and resolving all kinds of issues with orders. If you experience problems with your contact, don\u2019t hesitate to talk to a higher up about it. Your rep is an important part of the supply chain, and a bad rep could mean orders going wrong. Yikes! Handling Botched Orders \u00b6 Dropshipping isn\u2019t perfect, and there are lots of problem areas that you should be aware of. One of those issues: botched orders. Suppliers are bound to mess up an order here and there, especially if you\u2019re dealing with a larger supplier who gets a high volume of orders. Sometimes, this means the supplier sends the wrong item to the customer. Worst case scenario? They never ship the item at all. That idea can send shivers down a dropshipping merchant\u2019s spine, so it\u2019s best to be prepared for it. There\u2019s a 3-step process you can use for remedying order mistakes: Apologize to the customer . The first step is to admit the mistake and apologize for it. Do not blame your supplier. This makes you look like a poor retailer who can\u2019t own up to their mistakes. And remember, the customer should never know you have a supplier! So apologize right off the bat. Make it up to them . After you apologize, you\u2019ll need to correct the mistake in some way. The specific way you do that will depend on how big the mistake was. Sometimes you\u2019ll just want to send the correct product to the customer. Other times, you might want to refund the shipping cost or include a small freebie, such as a small amount of store credit. In any case, you need to make it right with your customer. Confront the supplier about the mistake . Even though you have to correct the mistake, your supplier should pay for it. Typically, a supplier will cover the shipping costs to return a wrong item or even send out a new one. They usually won\u2019t pay for any freebies or upgrades that you give the customer. So what happens if your supplier botches several orders within a short time frame? Nine times out of ten that means you have a bad supplier. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not a whole lot you can do when dealing with a low quality supplier. Start looking for another supplier who has a better reputation for fulfillment. And if you do leave a supplier, make sure you explicitly let them know why! After Getting a Supplier \u00b6 After you\u2019ve landed a supplier, take some time to see how they perform. After a few months, you\u2019ll have a sense of how efficient they are. Don\u2019t be afraid to break it off and look for another supplier if things aren\u2019t going so well. In Chapter 11 Chapter 11, I\u2019ll discuss suppliers a bit more and talk about working with multiple suppliers to fulfill all of your dropshipping needs. I do recommend starting out with one, but once you get the hang of it, dealing with more than one isn\u2019t a big deal at all.","title":"Ch09"},{"location":"en/ch09/#finding-dealing-with-suppliers","text":"Dropshipping 101: Ecommerce Without Inventory | Finding & Dealing With Suppliers Chapter 9 by Daniel Threlfall 30 Jun, 2020 It\u2019s been a long road so far, but it\u2019s finally time to start talking about suppliers. Now that you\u2019ve built up your business and understand your place in the market, you can work on building relationships with suppliers to get the actual products to sell. In this chapter, I\u2019ll give you a primer on how to find and contact suppliers.

Once you know which products you want to sell, find out who makes those products and contact them. Ask them for their list of wholesale distributors. This gives you an official list from the manufacturer themselves, so you know you\u2019ll be working with legitimate businesses. This strategy is quick and only takes a few calls. By calling different manufacturers in your niche, you might find the same wholesalers coming up again and again. This lets you know who the leading wholesalers are, and you barely have to do any work to find out.","title":"Contact the Product Manufacturer"},{"location":"en/ch09/#use-oberlo","text":"If you want to be able to easily find and even switch between different suppliers, give Oberlo a look.

No supplier will charge a monthly fee, but a supplier directory might. Supplier directories list wholesalers in all kinds of niches. There are two main benefits to directories: security and convenience. Directories are secure because they often screen wholesalers before listing them, and they\u2019re convenient because you can look up wholesalers by niche or product type. It can save you a lot of time when you\u2019re searching for suppliers. By no means are supplier directories necessary. They make your job easier if you have the money to spend on them, but you can find all of the legitimate wholesalers you need without ever touching a directory. All in all, directories are great for some dropshippers, but not for everyone. If you want to save some time and don\u2019t mind paying the price of admission, here are some of the most trusted and well-known directories. I\u2019m not endorsing or advertising for any of these. I just want you to know what your options are. Worldwide Brands Worldwide Brands \u2013 This is one of the oldest and most trustworthy supplier directories. Created in 1999, Worldwide Brands has a huge database of thousands of certified wholesalers. These wholesalers are all top-level, meaning they\u2019re not middlemen (i.e., the retailers who pretend to be wholesalers). If that\u2019s not enough, you can also browse over 10 million products. The cost is $299 for a lifetime membership, which is a great deal compared to many of the directories out there. If you\u2019re planning to rely heavily on a directory and you want one of the best, Worldwide Brands is definitely worth a look. Wholesale Central Wholesale Central \u2013 Wholesale Central is completely free. This might seem like a warning sign at first, and it\u2019s true that this directory has some issues. Even though Wholesale Central charges a listing fee to suppliers, not every listing is genuine. For one, most of the \u2018wholesalers seem to be retailers selling at \u2018wholesale\u2019 prices. Wholesale Central also claims to screen its applicants, but they don\u2019t specify what that process looks like, so it\u2019s very possible that some illegitimate suppliers are slipping through the cracks. Bottom line \u2013 feel free to browse it, but be cautious and do a lot of research before reaching out.","title":"Use Supplier Directories"},{"location":"en/ch09/#how-to-spot-fake-wholesalers","text":"Now that you know how to find suppliers, I\u2019m going to show you how to identify fake dropshipping suppliers. That\u2019s right \u2013 there are fakes out there. Some retail stores pose as wholesale suppliers so they can sell more, but they mark up the prices like crazy. You want to work with true wholesalers who buy directly from the manufacturer and can offer you much better pricing. If you go and look for wholesalers, it might be difficult to tell which ones are fake. In fact, it might be nearly impossible. That\u2019s because the fake ones often seem more credible. Unfortunately, legitimate wholesalers tend to be less marketing-savvy, so it\u2019s often more difficult to find them. Fake suppliers, on the other hand, often excel at marketing, so they\u2019ll pop up a lot when you search. There are a few telltale signs that give away fake dropshipping wholesalers: They sell products to the general public . Many retailers posing as wholesalers will sell to the public, often advertising \u2018wholesale prices\u2019 to make customers think they\u2019re getting a good deal. What they\u2019re really doing is selling products at inflated prices and then slapping the wholesale label on them. This is a dead giveaway that you\u2019re not dealing with a legitimate wholesaler. If you see a wholesaler listing their prices publicly, this is also a sign they\u2019re fake. A real wholesaler will never sell to the public. Furthermore, in order to make a deal with a wholesaler, you\u2019ll have to apply and be approved. Wholesalers won\u2019t work with just anybody. You have to prove you own your business and that it\u2019s a legitimate business. They charge ongoing fees . This is another way for fake suppliers to squeeze more money out of their unsuspecting victims. They\u2019ll charge a monthly fee just for doing business with them. No true wholesaler would ever do this. However, you might come across some wholesaler directories that may charge a fee. These directories are actually a good method of finding suppliers, so I\u2019ll discuss them shortly. Just be aware that a supplier will not ask for a base fee of any sort. They don\u2019t want to sign any contracts . This is a huge red flag. You will always need to sign a contract to enter into a legally binding business agreement before making any purchases. A supplier that refuses to sign a contract (or says it\u2019s not necessary) is fake.","title":"How to Spot Fake Wholesalers"},{"location":"en/ch09/#how-to-spot-legitimate-wholesalers","text":"So how do you find legitimate wholesalers to work with? Thankfully, it doesn\u2019t have to be a guessing game. Real wholesalers can be detected using a few simple criteria: They require you to apply . Whereas fake wholesalers won\u2019t have an application process, legitimate wholesalers will. You\u2019ll have to be legally incorporated, and the supplier will have to approve you. All of this will happen before you even see any prices. They have a minimum order size . It\u2019s common for suppliers to have a minimum order size, especially for your first order. This is because suppliers only want to work with serious businesses, so setting a minimum order size helps to filter out people who are just window shopping. Sometimes this can be problematic for dropshippers. Consider the following scenario. A supplier has a $500 minimum order, but the size of your average order is only $75. In this case, it seems like you\u2019d have to pay the $500 just to open the dropshipping account in the first place. What do you do? My advice is to turn the extra amount into credit to be applied to future orders. This way, you\u2019re meeting the minimum order size, but you don\u2019t have to order extra product. They have experienced staff and a dedicated support team . This is truly a hallmark of a top-notch supplier. You should be able to call up a representative who knows your niche and can answer any questions you have in detail. If the company reps don\u2019t seem knowledgeable, it\u2019s possible they were hired without any experience or training. On top of that, look out for a dedicated support team. If you\u2019re working with a wholesaler, you should be assigned one specific customer support member to take care of your needs. This will make problem solving easy. Having to call and email multiple team members only leads to confusion, and it makes problems worse. That\u2019s why having a single point of contact is so beneficial. Their technology is up-to-date . Remember when I said that legitimate wholesalers tend to be bad at marketing? Unfortunately, they also tend to be bad with technology as a whole. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it sure helps when your supplier has a polished website and interface. Being able to use features like real-time inventory, searchable order histories, and easy-to-use online catalogs are incredibly useful and save you lots of time. They have pre-order fees . While no retailer will charge monthly fees, many will charge small pre-order fees. These usually range from $1 to $5 per order or possibly more, depending on how large the order is. These fees cover the costs of packaging and shipping, since individual orders carry much higher fees than bulk orders do. They won\u2019t go over the top to persuade you to work with them . This is a tactic you\u2019ll see a lot with middlemen \u2018wholesalers\u2019. Since these businesses are just retailers, they\u2019re going to use sales tactics to try to get your money. They\u2019ll go on about their benefits and provide lots of information that\u2019s really useless. Real wholesalers won\u2019t bend over backward to work with you. They\u2019ll require you to apply, and they\u2019ll have stringent requirements. If a \u2018wholesaler\u2019 is throwing sales pitch after sales pitch at you, run for the hills.","title":"How to Spot Legitimate Wholesalers"},{"location":"en/ch09/#what-to-look-for-in-a-supplier","text":"Just because a certain supplier is legitimate, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the best option for you. Choosing the right suppliers can be a lengthy process, but it\u2019ll be worth it when you find one that ticks all of the boxes you need. To do that, you need to know how to spot a good supplier. If you\u2019re new to searching for suppliers, you may not even know where to start analyzing the quality of one supplier over another. Fear not, because I have some expert tips for you. It might not be obvious to look for these things, but they can save you insane amounts of time and money. They take orders by email . Having to call in an order instead of emailing may seem like a minor issue that you shouldn\u2019t raise a stink about. But think about a future where you\u2019re getting hundreds of orders every day. Do you want to have to call in all those orders (or hire someone to do it for you)? Even placing orders via the supplier\u2019s website can be time consuming. Being able to submit orders through email will be a blessing when you\u2019re getting inundated with new orders every hour. Thankfully, many wholesalers will accept email orders, but there are some who use other systems. Their location is prime for shipping . Assuming you\u2019re in the United States, think about where the best location for a supplier is. If the supplier only has one shipping center, it\u2019s makes the most sense for it to be in the middle of the country. This allows packages to get to 90% of the US in 2-4 business days. If the supplier is on either coast or perhaps far south, it can take more than a week for some orders to get in customers\u2019 hands. A centrally located supplier will give you consistent shipping results, and on average it will only take a few days for people to get their items. International shipping is a whole different ball game, of course, but for domestic shipping, a central location is ideal. Their processes are efficient . Obviously you don\u2019t want to work with suppliers who constantly botch orders or make mistakes. But how can you know that without actually working with them? Unfortunately, you really can\u2019t. What you can do is place a few test orders. This won\u2019t conclusively prove the supplier\u2019s quality, but it will give you some helpful information. You can see what the order process looks like from your side, how long the shipping takes, and how the items arrive. For example, if the supplier doesn\u2019t send out tracking information within a few days, that could be a red flag. The entire process should be smooth and seamless, from the order to the delivery.","title":"What to Look for in a Supplier"},{"location":"en/ch09/#getting-ready-to-contact-suppliers","text":"After you\u2019ve compiled a list of suppliers you\u2019d like to contact, you\u2019ll need to take care of a few more things before you actually reach out.

As I said earlier, most wholesalers will require proof that your business is indeed legal, and that means incorporation.

Wholesalers are there to do business, and they get tons of spam every day from people who waste their time. You don\u2019t want to be one of those people. You need to show them you mean business, and a lot of that proof comes with how you present yourself. If you get straight to the point and don\u2019t ask a million questions, the supplier will know you\u2019re serious. So it\u2019s important to know what you\u2019re looking for well before you ever pick up the phone or type an email.

Carefully planned marketing strategies are essential in ensuring the success of any dropshipping business, as it\u2019s marketing that drives traffic \u2013 and thus, sales \u2013 to your store. The good news is that there are lots of low-cost marketing strategies available, and you don\u2019t need to hire a marketer to start out. Marketing for Ecommerce Marketing for Ecommerce is quite accessible, and it\u2019s good to know the basics even if you end up outsourcing marketing outsourcing marketing in the future. These concepts will help you define what types of people you\u2019re targeting and how you\u2019re going to reach them. Creating Buyer Personas \u00b6 You already know who you want to sell to, but how specific can you get? Do you know your average customer\u2019s income or education level? All good marketing strategies should involve taking a detailed look at your potential customers. One way to get such a detailed view of your customers is by building a buyer persona. These are basically profiles of fictional customers who represent your audience as a whole. The personas are constructed from demographics and psychographics that are averaged together. The idea is that by marketing to a few fictional people, you can effectively market to your entire customer base. Here\u2019s what a buyer persona buyer persona looks like: buyer persona This is a simple buyer persona, but you can get really complex if you want it to be. While it\u2019s not always necessary to have a bunch of details, it can help. To create a buyer persona for your business, you\u2019ll need to research two types of statistics I mentioned earlier: demographics and psychographics. Demographics tell you who your audience is. You\u2019ll find statistics like: Age range Location Education level Income Family information Psychographics tell you why your audience wants to buy products. They give you insight into your customers\u2019 motives so you can upgrade your marketing strategy to appeal to them better. Here\u2019s a quick method of grabbing some basic demographics and psychographics. It uses Google Analytics (GA), a simple analytics tool that even expert marketers use. If you were comfortable with using Keyword Planner in Chapter 5 Chapter 5, you\u2019ll have no problem with GA. Navigate to https://analytics.google.com https://analytics.google.com and log in. You should see a sidebar on the left side of the page. Go to Audience , then Demographics . In the drop down, select Overview . marketing strategies You\u2019ll see a couple of charts that give you information about age and gender. buyer demographics This isn\u2019t incredibly detailed, but it gives you an overview of these two vital statistics. Don\u2019t forget that you can adjust the time frame for these metrics to get an idea of how they\u2019ve evolved over time. For psychographics, go to the sidebar and navigate to Audience > Interests > Overview. audience demographics You\u2019ll see a few categories that tell you about your audience\u2019s interests. This data can help you understand what sort of topics your customers and visitors like. demographic research This is surprisingly useful, and there are a wide range of applications. For example, you could investigate these niches to see if they intersect your own. Let\u2019s go back to the example of selling water bottles. If you find out a lot of your customers like the technology niche, you could see about selling a smart water bottle that can track how much water someone drinks. That\u2019s just one idea \u2013 the possibilities are endless. If you want to get more detailed demographic and psychographic data, there are other tools you can use. You can also leverage user-generated content, like contest entries or survey responses, to collect this sort of information. Once you\u2019ve gotten enough demographics and psychographics, you can create a buyer persona like the one included at the beginning of this chapter. I recommend starting out with two (one male, one female) and using those for a while. If you\u2019re running into trouble, try creating additional personas, as you can focus on other data points and potentially learn something new about your audience. A detailed buyer persona can help inform and improve your marketing strategies drastically. Creating Negative Buyer Personas \u00b6 You can also create negative buyer personas if you want to take a super-targeted approach to marketing. This step isn\u2019t necessary, but it doesn\u2019t hurt. negative buyer personas Image source A negative persona is the type of person you don\u2019t want to sell to. At first, this seems crazy. Why would you want to avoid selling to some people? Because not everyone is part of your audience. If your niche is fishing products, you won\u2019t want to market to firefighters. Negative personas narrow down your list of who you should be targeting. Negative buyer personas are trickier to create because it\u2019s hard to know who to exclude. A good starting point is to think about who your problem customers are. This gets easier once you\u2019ve been in business for a while and have interacted with lots of different types of people. Then you can create a buyer persona like you usually would, only this time you\u2019ll be focusing on customer types to avoid. This is one of the more advanced marketing strategies that can really help you concentrate on the specific types of people who will love your products. Low-Cost Marketing Strategies \u00b6 Now that you know who to market to, it\u2019s time to do the actual marketing. First I\u2019ll introduce some free or low-cost marketing strategies, and then I\u2019ll go over some tactics that involve a bigger financial investment. Display Ads \u00b6 The marketing world has come a long way in the last several years. Display ads used to be those annoying top bar or sidebar banners that would flash to get your attention. Nowadays, display advertising is much more organic, which means they can form an effective part of online marketing strategies online marketing strategies. Take a look at this display ad from Volkswagen: display ad marketing This is an excellent example of what great display advertising looks like what great display advertising looks like. It\u2019s interactive, eye-catching, and fun. Don\u2019t get me wrong: there are still tons of awful ads on the Internet. If you want your ads to get people coming to your store, you have to follow some important guidelines. Make it about the customer . No one likes to be sold to, but people do like products that benefit them. Your ad should solve a problem the viewer is having. How do you find these problems? Through research, especially psychographics. A specific product you sell can solve one or many problems, but you have to find out which angle to take. In short, make your ads about how the viewer\u2019s life will be better with your product. Be thoughtful about where to run ads . Dropshippers who run ads and place them everywhere see few results. Remember, you\u2019re not selling to everyone in the world. Heck, you\u2019re not even selling to everyone in your niche \u2013 remember what I said about negative buyer personas. You need to think strategically about the kinds of sites that would benefit you the most. A good technique is to visit influential sites in your niche and look for an advertising page. You\u2019ll often find this in the footer or sometimes the navigation bar. Ideally, you want to build relationships with these influencers. Start by sending an email inquiring about ad space, asking about rates, etc. Don\u2019t try to force anything, and don\u2019t work with sites that aren\u2019t right for you. Let the conversations happen naturally, and you might be surprised at what happens. If display ads interest you, you should know that there are two main methods of purchasing ads: working with one site or working with a large ad network. As with most things in dropshipping, one isn\u2019t always better than the other, so what\u2019s right for someone else may be wrong for you. Working with one website often plays out as I described above. You find the site\u2019s advertising page, reach out, and get an ad spot. If you take this approach, think about becoming a regular advertiser. This is a great way to build strong relationships with other sites and their audiences. You\u2019ll get your brand in front of more people, and you\u2019ll have the beginnings of a robust professional network. If you want to advertise to more people and are willing to compromise, an ad network can help get your brand out into the world. These networks are basically middlemen between you and the sites that your ads are displayed on. This is an easy method of getting lots of ads out on various websites, and often it\u2019s cost effective. However, you can\u2019t really build business relationships this way, and you can\u2019t be as targeted with your ads. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) \u00b6 If you\u2019ve ever read any article about creating a website or starting a business online, you\u2019ve no doubt heard about SEO more times than you can count. Plenty of online marketing strategies have incorporated SEO for years, and this approach isn\u2019t going anywhere. Essentially, SEO improves the visibility of your site in search engines. If your site has good SEO, someone searching for a product type you carry will see your site on Google. This is why so many marketers shout the benefits of SEO from the rooftops. SEO can be difficult to categorize because it\u2019s made up of so many elements. I\u2019m not going to go over several SEO techniques in depth, but I will introduce some critical concepts that will help to increase your search engine ranking. SEO breaks down into two types: on-page and off-page. On-page SEO deals with the content on your website, and off-page SEO happens outside of your site. On-page SEO There\u2019s a lot I could say about on-page SEO, but if I had to distill it into one sentence, it would be this: optimize your title tags, metadata, headings, and file information. If you\u2019re new to SEO, you probably have no idea what this means. That\u2019s okay \u2013 it\u2019s a breeze to master this. I\u2019ll break this down piece by piece. online marketing strategies Image source Title tags are what show up in Google as the title of your page or article. Although this seems like off-page SEO (since it matters most outside of your site), you define the title tag within your website. A good title tag should use a focus keyword, and that keyword should be as close to the beginning as possible. It also shouldn\u2019t be too long, or else it\u2019ll get cut off. The meta description (sometimes referred to as the meta) is the small snippet of text that accompanies the title tag and URL in a search result. This is a great place to tell readers more about the page, and it doesn\u2019t hurt to pop in a couple of keywords either. Here\u2019s a diagram Here\u2019s a diagram that points to the locations of the title tag and meta description: seo for dropshipping site Next, let\u2019s talk about headings. In a piece of content, say a blog post, you\u2019ll often have headings and subheadings to break up the text. Search engines love finding these on pages because they aid in reading comprehension. Finally, by file information, I mean adding more detail about the files within your site. There are a few things you\u2019ll want to do: Make sure all of your images have filenames and alt text Optimize your sitemap.xml file Set up your robots.txt This might sound complex, but if you check out a few articles, you\u2019ll have this down faster than you think. These are all really important aspects of on-page SEO, and you should definitely research them. There are way more on-page SEO techniques, like having a short and keyword-focused URL, but going over those would take a long time. So I encourage you to do some reading about on-page SEO and get comfortable with it. Off-page SEO For the purposes of this guide, I\u2019m only going to talk about one element of off-page SEO: backlinks. By no means is this the only important off-page tactic, but it\u2019s the most foundational one. It\u2019s commonly known that the more links a site has, the better it will rank. However, this statement needs a little qualification. I think a more accurate phrasing is the more high quality links a site has over time, the better it will rank. Getting links is a long-term plan, and you don\u2019t want to get links from anywhere and everywhere. First, your links need to be natural your links need to be natural. This means not paying for links. I know, everyone doesn\u2019t, but you shouldn\u2019t. Paid links hurt your SEO, and you\u2019ll often get penalized if Google detects a paid link going to or from your site. Second, you need to build a network of links. You want to have a lot of root domains linking to your site. Recall the section on using Moz Open Site Explorer. This will ensure you get the most juice out of your links, and it also allows you to build those crucial relationships with influencers and website owners. Third, aim to get high-value backlinks get high-value backlinks. Some backlinks will pass along ranking power to your site, and these are called follow or dofollow links. Other types called nofollow won\u2019t pass on any of this so-called \u2018link juice\u2019. As a rule of thumb, always try to get dofollow backlinks. Again, backlinks are just the tip of the iceberg that is off-page SEO. Interestingly, off-page SEO is ignored by many site owners because it\u2019s not as popular, so if you put in the work, you could gain an advantage over your competition. High-Cost Marketing Strategies \u00b6 The saying \u201cit takes money to make money\u201d is true at times. This applies to marketing too. Sometimes, it\u2019s best to pony up and make a considerable investment if you want to see the kinds of crazy results that you hear about. Influencer marketing . This is currently one of the hottest marketing strategies because it can drive sales like nothing else. If an influencer shouts out your product, you can expect to see some serious traffic and hopefully lots of conversions. At this point, influencer marketing is its own legitimate subcategory of marketing. There are lots of strategies to take your influencer marketing game to the next level strategies to take your influencer marketing game to the next level. It\u2019s excellent for dropshippers because it\u2019s easy for an influencer to show off a product, as opposed to a service. Contests, giveaways, and promotions . Giving away products, providing discounts, and running sales can all boost your bottom line, but you have to do it carefully. After all, you don\u2019t want to be giving away free products all the time! You might consider offering regular seasonal sales and hosting contests or giveaways for special occasions. On the technical side, this is one of the easiest methods of improving marketing strategies. For example, you can use a contest app (like Gleam Competitions for Shopify Gleam Competitions for Shopify) to set everything up in a few minutes. Learning More About Marketing Strategies \u00b6 While you don\u2019t have to become a marketing master, understanding how to use some basic marketing techniques can take you a long way. If you want to do more marketing, I highly suggest reading some articles about marketing strategies marketing strategies and techniques and learning about the newest marketing trends marketing trends. It takes a while to learn the ins and outs of marketing, but you can learn as you go.","title":"Marketing"},{"location":"en/ch10/#marketing","text":"Dropshipping 101: Ecommerce Without Inventory | Marketing Chapter 10 by Daniel Threlfall 30 Jun, 2020 After you incorporate your business, find a supplier, and start making sales, you\u2019ll want to get the word out about your shiny new storefront.

Now that your business is up and running, I\u2019m guessing you want to know how to manage and grow it. Running a tight ship is crucial, and if you don\u2019t make any changes or try to achieve specific goals, your dropshipping business won\u2019t last long. In this chapter, I\u2019ll outline how you can create stability within your business, and then I\u2019ll suggest some ways to expand. Dealing with Problems \u00b6 As you sell more, you\u2019ll be faced with problems. This happens to the best dropshippers, and if you don\u2019t know how to deal with these problems ahead of time, your business (and reputation) will suffer. First, always expect the unexpected. Even when things are going smoothly, you never know when your supplier is going to botch an order or when a customer will send you an angry email. There are lots of surprises in dropshipping, so try not to get caught off guard when these things happen. Here are a couple of the problems you might face and some ways to remedy them. Returns and Chargebacks \u00b6 For one reason or another, you\u2019ll likely get customers returning items. In some cases, you may get chargebacks on orders. These are both specific problems, so I\u2019ll tackle them one at a time. Returns . First of all, you\u2019ll want to have a return policy in place. This will largely determine on what your suppliers\u2019 return policies are. If your supplier has a 30-day return policy, you don\u2019t want to have a 45-day window, so base your policy off your suppliers\u2019 rules. Second, understand the structure of a return. After the customer requests a return, you\u2019ll need to get an RMA (return merchandise authorization) number from your supplier. The customer sends the item to the supplier, noting the RMA on the address. Then, your supplier refunds you the wholesale price of the product, and you refund the customer for the full retail price. Third, be aware of some issues that may pop up. For example, some suppliers charge restocking fees. This can cause confusion \u2013 who eats the fee? I recommend taking the loss and not making your customer pay the restocking fee. Yes, you\u2019ll lose a little profit here and there, but your policy will be much friendlier to your customers. What about items that are defective? Generally, suppliers won\u2019t cover return shipping for damaged or broken products, so that\u2019s another fee you have to pay. That said, you always need to cover return shipping, whether or not your supplier does. This is part of having a good business that treats its customers right. A common practice for defective items is simply shipping the customer a new item and allowing them to keep the old one. While this makes the customer stuck with a broken product, it\u2019s cost effective since suppliers will usually cover the shipping costs of sending a new item out. Chargebacks . A chargeback happens when a customer calls his or her bank/credit card company and disputes a charge. If you get a chargeback from a sale you made, you might be confused. That\u2019s because chargebacks only happen for a handful of reasons. Most often, chargebacks will be fraudulent. These are pretty easy to handle. You just need to provide proof that you sent the item and that it was delivered. This typically means showing the exact order, shipping/tracking information, and a wholesale packing slip that details the items you purchased and shipped to the customer. Just don\u2019t wait too long to respond to a chargeback! You only have a few days before you\u2019re hit with that fee. Here\u2019s some more information on dealing dealing with fraudulent chargebacks with fraudulent chargebacks. There is a bit of bad news, though. If the chargeback is on an order with different shipping and billing addresses, it\u2019s nearly impossible to win. Sadly, if this happens I recommend eating the fee and writing it off as a loss. Shipping Issues \u00b6 Speaking of shipping costs, there can be many complications with shipping. Most dropshippers have trouble with rates. Depending on which carrier you choose, you\u2019ll have any number of rate options to choose from, and it can be daunting. Here are three shipping rates you\u2019ll commonly encounter: Real-time rates . \u2018Real-time\u2019 simply means that a custom shipping quote is generated for each order. The weight of the products and the destination factor in to give you the final quote. This is highly accurate, but it can be difficult to implement. Per type rates . Per type shipping uses flat fees for different sizes of products. For example, all products under five pounds might ship for $5. Flat rate shipping . This is one of the most popular shipping options because it\u2019s super easy. You just charge one flat rate for all shipments. This means you\u2019ll lose money on some orders but make it back on others. While it\u2019s not a very accurate method, it is simple and direct. Many merchants who use flat rate shipping choose to offer free shipping sitewide and build the shipping costs into the product prices. This isn\u2019t a universal solution; free shipping works great for some situations but not all of them free shipping works great for some situations but not all of them. But if you can do it, offering free shipping is a nice way to appeal even more to your customers. So which one of these should you go with? Flat rate shipping is what many dropshippers use, so you should definitely consider it. It\u2019s also the easiest rate to implement when you\u2019re first starting out. I recommend using flat rate at first and seeing how it goes. If you feel you could benefit more from another rate type, by all means look into it. What about international shipping? Since most niches have a global market, this is something you\u2019ll need to face sooner or later. Be ready to think about the additional costs of international shipping, and browse your carrier options to see which one has the best rates for you. You can offer domestic shipping only, but depending on your niche, this could harm your sales. While we\u2019re on the subject of carrier, I\u2019ll talk briefly about the options you have. In the US, you\u2019re basically choosing between UPS/FedEx and the United States Postal Service (USPS). UPS/FedEx \u2013 If you\u2019re regularly shipping large packages, UPS and FedEx will give you better rates. Unfortunately their international rates are somewhat pricey. USPS \u2013 If you\u2019re mainly shipping small packages, USPS is the way to go. You can usually ship small packages for under $5. USPS also has much better international rates than UPS or FedEx. For shipping both smaller and larger packages, it doesn\u2019t hurt to use two (or even all three) carriers. Think about which carriers will have the best rates for specific sizes and destinations. Managing Customer Support \u00b6 For a small business to be incredibly successful, it has to have a great customer support solution. I\u2019ve seen a lot of dropshippers use nothing more than a business Gmail account an an Excel spreadsheet to manage customer support. This \u2018solution\u2019 is the equivalent of fixing up your car with duct tape. Sure, it works for a while, but it\u2019s not going to last forever. It\u2019s ideal to use dedicated support software from day one. Help desk software can scale alongside your business, and it\u2019s easy to use. There are many options for you to choose from. Here are a few of my favorites: Zendesk \u2013 One of the biggest names in customer support, Zendesk is one of the most popular choices. It also offers a wide range of pricing options, so you can start off small if you need to. Help Scout \u2013 Help Scout is big on personalization. Support tickets are designed to look like regular emails, so your customers won\u2019t feel like they\u2019re receiving a canned response. Desk \u2013 Desk is operated by the highly regarded Salesforce, and like Salesforce, it\u2019s a powerful platform that centralizes everything and makes support easier to manage. Many dropshippers use one of these platforms, but there are lots of options out there. Find something that works for you and stick with it. The software you choose should also be able to accommodate a growing team. Although more antiquated, phone support is also something to think about. This is especially vital for dropshippers selling items with larger price tags. All the way back in Chapter 5, I mentioned that people buying more expensive items will often want to speak to a team member on the phone. So if you\u2019re planning on selling pricier products, plan on getting phone support. Grasshopper is a good starting point that works well for small businesses. Using Multiple Suppliers \u00b6 While I requested starting out with just one supplier, most medium-sized dropshipping merchants use more than one. If you\u2019re selling a lot of product, having multiple suppliers at your disposal can make your job a lot easier. There are several benefits to working with more than one supplier: Order fulfillment is easier . When you\u2019re working with just one supplier and an item\u2019s out of stock, you\u2019re out of luck. Using multiple suppliers with overlapping inventories increases the chances that a product will always be available to you. You can pick and choose . Being able to cherry pick the best products from various suppliers is a big deal. Say you\u2019re after a specific product. If Supplier A doesn\u2019t have it, Supplier B might. This simplifies product selection. It gives you a safety net . If a supplier unexpectedly raises its prices or shuts down, you can count on your other suppliers to keep you in business. And once you\u2019ve found a supplier, it\u2019s a snap to find others. Managing Inventory \u00b6 Keeping track of the products you have available to you is a must. Out-of-stock items can lower your conversion and retention rates, as it\u2019s highly inconvenient for a customer to be told their item isn\u2019t currently available. Here are a few tips for mitigating the number of out-of-stock products in your store. Ask your supplier(s) about item availability . Some suppliers may not stock all of their items regularly. Some products may be seasonal, for example. Ask your supplier(s) about this and make sure that your most popular products are available year-round (or close to year-round). Don\u2019t be afraid to use generic products. Let\u2019s say you have two suppliers. If you want to sell something common, like a water bottle, chances are both suppliers have similar products in stock. Supplier A\u2019s water bottle may not be identical to Supplier B\u2019s bottle, but if they\u2019re nearly identical, you can often write a generic product description and sell both bottles under the same listing. (Of course, don\u2019t substitute for big brands like Samsung or Adidas.) Use a robust inventory solution . Suppliers will typically have their own way to manage inventory, and if it\u2019s good enough, use it. If you find it lacking, look into software like Ordoro or HubLogix . These tools can also help you manage inventory across multiple suppliers. Building a Team \u00b6 When you start out, you can easily run your business all by yourself. As you grow, you might get overwhelmed with tons of daily orders, support tickets, and other administrative duties. That\u2019s when you should think about getting more people on board. But who should you hire and when? Typically, dropshipping merchants can benefit the most from hiring certain roles. Virtual assistants . Virtual assistants Virtual assistants (or VAs) can be helpful if you mostly need assistance with administrative matters like processing invoices or organizing documents. It\u2019s usually fairly cheap to hire a good VA too. However, a VA can only do so much. While a VA can help keep everything on track, he or she can\u2019t take over marketing duties, for instance. Customer support representatives . If you\u2019re getting a steady flow of support tickets and messages from customers, it could be worthwhile to hire a dedicated customer support rep. This will free up your time to focus on higher level responsibilities. SEOs, marketers, copywriters, and designers . Depending on your exact business model and goals, you may want to hire some freelancers to do some once-off work. For instance, if you\u2019re running into problems with visibility in the SERPs, hiring an SEO to optimize your site could help. You may already know some people to fill these roles, but just be aware that you\u2019ll likely need all of these services at one point or another. Only you can determine if it\u2019s worth it to hire salaried employees in these roles.","title":"Growing Your Dropshipping Business"},{"location":"en/ch11/#growing-your-dropshipping-business","text":"Dropshipping 101: Ecommerce Without Inventory | Growing Your Dropshipping Business Chapter 11 by Daniel Threlfall 30 Jun, 2020 You\u2019ve made it to the final chapter: congratulations!

In fact, by just reading this guide, you\u2019re more equipped than a lot of current business owners were at the start of their careers. With that in mind, I want to remind you that you can do it. You don\u2019t have to have a perfect business right now. You just need to start taking action toward building a business of your own. If you create a business with the goal of providing value, you\u2019ll be able to move past all your shortcomings and fire up a successful business. So many people today just want to make money fast, and customers see right through that. You have to have a desire to improve people\u2019s lives if you want your business to last. The entrepreneurs who have been so successful didn\u2019t get to where they are today by doing everything flawlessly. They all made more mistakes than they could count. You\u2019ll do the same on your journey. You\u2019ll fall, pick yourself up again, and find out how to stop falling. It\u2019s a long road, but if you start today, you\u2019ll be surprised at how fast you can move.","title":"Conclusion"},{"location":"en/ch12/#glossary","text":"Business structure \u2013 A business\u2019s legal status and associated classifications.

Dropshipping is easy to grow. As you scale up, your business model doesn\u2019t have to change very much at all. You\u2019ll have to put more work into sales and marketing as you grow, but your day-to-day will stay more or less the same. One of the benefits of dropshipping is that the costs don\u2019t skyrocket when you scale . Because of this, it\u2019s easy to keep growing at a pretty fast rate. You can do almost everything by yourself, too, unless you want to assemble a small team at some point. Dropshipping doesn\u2019t demand a lot of capital. Because starting a dropshipping business requires so little, you can get started with minimal funds. You can build an entire business right from your laptop, and you don\u2019t need to make any high-level investments. Even as your business grows, your costs will be fairly low \u2013 especially when compared to traditional business expenses. Dropshipping is flexible. This is one of its biggest benefits. You get to be your own boss and set your own rules . It\u2019s by far one of the most flexible careers that anyone can pursue. You can work from home with little more than a laptop, and you can work at the times that are most convenient for you. This is ideal for entrepreneurs who want a business that works for them. You won\u2019t have to bend over backwards to get things done. Instead, you set your own pace. Dropshipping is also flexible in that it gives you a lot of room to make decisions that work for you. You can easily list new products whenever you want, and you can adjust your strategies on the fly. If you\u2019re going on vacation, you can automate everything to run while you\u2019re away. You get the idea \u2013 the possibilities are limitless. Dropshipping is easy to manage. Since it doesn\u2019t require you to make many commitments, you can manage everything with little hassle. Once you\u2019ve found suppliers and set everything up , you\u2019re mostly only responsible for your online storefront. Disadvantages of Dropshipping Disadvantages of Dropshipping \u00b6 Dropshipping has slim margins. One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you should expect low margins initially. That\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t be profitable, but you should be aware that the product margin in some niches might be small. This issue is especially problematic when you\u2019re dropshipping in a super-competitive niche . When you\u2019re fighting for customers\u2019 attention, you can\u2019t afford to make the kind of profits you want to. If you choose the right niche, you\u2019ll see larger margins. In niches with lower competition, you\u2019ll have better margins, but at some point sales will start to plateau. That\u2019s why dropshipping relies on a fair amount of sales to be profitable. Dropshipping can make order processing difficult. Dropshipping seems straightforward: The customer orders, you process, and your supplier fulfills. And for the most part, it is simple. However, if you\u2019re sourcing products from multiple suppliers, you might run into some problems. Each of your suppliers might use a different shipping solution, which presents a problem for both you and your customers. Costs can get high, and shipping multiple products can be problematic. Different suppliers will also have different structures in place for processing and billing. Since you have to manage the interaction with your suppliers, this can get tricky. Dropshipping doesn\u2019t give you a lot of control. One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you don\u2019t have much control over certain aspects of the dropshipping process such as stocking products, order fulfillment, and shipping. You have to rely on your suppliers to do everything right and work seamlessly. This lack of control can be off-putting to some entrepreneurs, but it usually isn\u2019t a problem. This just means that when something goes wrong, it can be tricky to manage. While supplier problems can sometimes cause customer retention issues, you can mitigate them and keep customer churn to an absolute minimum with the right damage control. Dropshipping makes customer service more challenging. This is another problem that happens when orders go wrong or suppliers fail. Because you\u2019re just the storefront and don\u2019t have a lot of control, it can be difficult to sort out orders and handle customer support. One of the most unfortunate disadvantages of dropshipping is that you have to take the blame when your customers complain. You could be doing everything right and still run into problems if your suppliers have issues. Is Dropshipping for You? \u00b6 Because there are both pros and cons of dropshipping, it isn\u2019t for everyone. This is especially true for people who are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme. Even if this isn\u2019t your approach, you still might have one of these fears: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have enough time to start a business.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to risk getting fired from my day job.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to work so hard on dropshipping that I underperform at my 9-to-5.\u201d That said, nearly anyone can build a dropshipping business because you can put as much or as little into dropshipping as you want. Here are two common approaches. Is Dropshipping Profitable? \u00b6 There are many ways to start and grow a dropshipping business. Our success stories talk about merchants who have started dropshipping businesses to make a few extra hundred bucks a month, while others have grown multiple six-figure stores. Whether you are looking to start dropshipping as an introduction into ecommerce or a business model to last forever, it is important to understand how dropshipping can be profitable to you. Dropshipping as a Side Hustle \u00b6 best side hustle jobs What is dropshipping\u2019s main appeal? Because it\u2019s flexible and it doesn\u2019t demand much, it\u2019s the ideal side job. Many entrepreneurs choose to do dropshipping on the side while they have a main job that provides steady income. In other words, you don\u2019t have to sacrifice your day job to pursue your dreams of becoming an entrepreneur. The No. 1 worry here is that your employer will prevent you from having a side hustle , but believe it or not, many companies are fine with it. You\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re in the clear by asking about your company\u2019s policy on side businesses and review any non-compete agreements you\u2019ve signed. You also definitely want to ensure there\u2019s no conflict of interest. But if everything checks out, then you\u2019re good to go. You don\u2019t need to dedicate too much time and energy to dropshipping, meaning you\u2019ll likely be able to take it on without a hitch. Worried that your side hustle will make you underperform? You don\u2019t have to be! You can spend only a couple hours on your business every day and still succeed. However, it\u2019s important to know your limits. If you regularly work overtime at your day job and struggle to find time for important daily responsibilities, you might not be able to give a dropshipping business the attention it needs. Even though dropshipping doesn\u2019t require a lot, you do need to carve out time in your day for it. In most cases, it just takes a little bit of time management and scheduling . Plenty of dropshipping retailers manage their main and side jobs easily. You don\u2019t need to sleep three hours a night or skip meals to make it work. You\u2019ll need to figure out a schedule that works for you and stick to it religiously. Dropshipping as a Full-Time Ecommerce Business \u00b6 eCommerce Business One of the benefits of dropshipping is the flexibility. You can make your business as big or as small as you want it to be. Many dropshippers choose to do it on the side, but it\u2019s also a viable career path. If you want to be a full-time dropshipping retailer, you can be! It\u2019s easy to scale up your business with dropshipping, meaning you can grow your business pretty quickly while keeping costs down. Once you\u2019ve reached customers and gotten enough sales, you can move from dropshipping part-time to full-time. Best of all, you can make this happen at whatever pace you want. Obviously, this is going to take more work, but the payoff is well worth it. Once you figure out how to dropship effectively, you won\u2019t have to worry about unsteady revenue. A well-established dropshipping ecommerce business operates like clockwork, and it can even feel like you\u2019re generating passive income. And since it doesn\u2019t take up a lot of time, you could even take on a side hustle while still being a full-time dropshipping retailer! The sky\u2019s the limit. Maybe you\u2019re rolling your eyes right now at the thought of becoming a full-time dropshipper, but there are thousands of success stories from entrepreneurs who started out right where you are today. It doesn\u2019t take a degree in business or millions in capital to make a living from it. Plus, our dropshipping tutorial makes it easy to get started. The Dropshipping Process \u00b6 Now that we\u2019ve covered what dropshipping is, let\u2019s discuss exactly how it works. Here\u2019s a step-by-step overview of the entire dropshipping process as well as a look at what the customer experiences (and why it matters). what is dropshipping Understanding the Supply Chain \u00b6 In this guide, you\u2019ll see the term \u201c supply chain\u201d \u201d a lot. It sounds like fancy industry lingo, but it simply refers to how a product moves from supplier to customer. We\u2019ll use this to discuss the dropshipping process. the supply chain process Image source You, the retailer, are just one piece of the puzzle. A successful dropshipping operation relies on multiple parties all working together in sync. The supply chain is exactly that: the coordination of the manufacturer, supplier, and retailer. The supply chain can be broken down into three basic steps: The manufacturer creates the products and sells them in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers. Let\u2019s say Manufacturer A makes water bottles. After the bottles roll off the production line, they\u2019re sold in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers, who turn around and resell the bottles to retailers. Suppliers and wholesalers sell the products to retailers. A retailer like yourself searches out a supplier for a specific type of product. The retailer and supplier then enter into an agreement to work together. Image source A small note here: While you can buy directly from product manufacturers, it\u2019s often much easier to purchase from suppliers instead. Most manufacturers have minimum purchase requirements that can be rather high, and you\u2019d also have to store, stock, and ship the products. So, it might seem simpler to buy straight from the manufacturer, but you\u2019ll benefit most from buying from suppliers (and dealing with the slight markup). Suppliers are also convenient because many of them specialize in a certain niche, so you can easily find the kind of products you need. This also means you can get started selling super quickly. Retailers sell the products to consumers. Suppliers and wholesalers do not sell directly to the public; that\u2019s the retailer\u2019s job. The retailer is the final step between the product and the consumer. Retailers provide online storefronts from which consumers purchase products. After the wholesaler marks up the product, the retailer marks it up yet again to arrive at the final price. By \u201cmarkup,\u201d we\u2019re referring to setting a price that covers the cost price of the item and brings you a profit. That\u2019s it! That\u2019s the entire supply chain from start to finish. It\u2019s a straightforward but crucial concept in business. You might have noticed that no one specific party was referred to as a dropshipper. That\u2019s because \u201cdropshipper\u201d is not a specific role. Dropshipping is simply the action of shipping products for someone else. Manufacturers, suppliers, and merchants can all technically be dropshippers. Later in this guide, we\u2019ll cover how to start a dropshipping retail business. In other words, you\u2019ll learn how to become the merchant that purchases products from wholesalers to sell to the public. This could mean you sell via eBay or your own website with an online storefront. Now that you know what the supply chain looks like, consider what it\u2019s like for the customer. Dropshipping and Customer Experiences \u00b6 You\u2019ve bought products online hundreds of times before, but you\u2019ve probably never thought about the experience. It\u2019s second nature for consumers. As a customer, you don\u2019t need to think about it, but as a retailer, you absolutely should. Image source Retailers can learn a lot by thinking about the ideal customer experience of ordering from a retailer. This may seem obvious, but if there are any snags in the customer experience, it could spell trouble for you as a retailer. It\u2019s important to know what your buyers expect. Let\u2019s pretend you have a business called Fancy Water Bottles, a site called FancyWaterBottles.com, and a wholesaler called Water Bottles Worldwide. Here\u2019s what the ordering process would look like from the customer\u2019s perspective: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and immediately receives an email confirmation of the purchase. After a few hours and up to a couple of days, Customer A receives a notification that their order has shipped. The notification includes tracking information, so Customer A knows exactly where their package is while en route. Customer A receives the water bottle. It\u2019s the same process you\u2019ve gone through each time you\u2019ve purchased anything online. This seems basic, but there are two important aspects of this experience. First, it\u2019s simple. All the customer has to do is order the product and pay for it. Everything else, like an order confirmation email and tracking information, is handed to them on a silver platter. And that brings us to our second point: convenience. The buying experience is extremely convenient in every way. An online purchase takes just minutes to make, and customers can browse any retailer\u2019s site at their leisure. And if all goes well, the customer won\u2019t even have to interact with anyone. It takes the minimum amount of effort to achieve the desired result of getting a product. This experience is a lot like buying a water bottle at a big box store and using the self-checkout. It\u2019s a no-fuss process that doesn\u2019t present any problems. This is a big reason why people buy online in the first place, so your storefront has to give your customers that same level of convenience. Last but not least, the customer should never notice that any other parties besides the retailer are involved. Think about it. When you buy something online, you think, \u201cI bought a water bottle from Fancy Water Bottles.\u201d You don\u2019t consider where the retailer got the product or who might be shipping your order. To make the process seamless, the customer shouldn\u2019t be aware of all the stops their product makes. The package they receive will have your retail name on it, so as far as the customer is concerned, you fulfilled and shipped the order. This is how the dropshipping process should ideally look from the customer\u2019s point of view. Now, let\u2019s break down what happens on the other end. Dropshipping Behind the Scenes \u00b6 That\u2019s what the customer sees, but what is dropshipping like behind the scenes?. Here\u2019s an overview of the process: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and receives an email confirmation of the process. Let\u2019s say the total came to $14.95.Fancy Water Bottles receives the same email confirmation as well as Customer A\u2019s payment. This is usually made possible by automated software that sends out the confirmation to both buyer and seller. Fancy Water Bottles sends the order to Water Bottles Worldwide. Typically, a sales representative from Water Bottles Worldwide will receive and process the order. The retailer will then be charged for the purchase. For this example, let\u2019s say Water Bottles Worldwide charges $12.95 for each water bottle. The retailer will pay that amount, and the difference is the profit the retailer will make. In this case, the retailer will net a profit of $2.00. Water Bottles Worldwide packs up the order.Although the wholesaler ships the product, the package will be addressed from Fancy Water Bottles, and the Fancy Water Bottles name will appear on the invoice and packing slip. (This is so the customer will recognize the retailer\u2019s name on the package.) The wholesaler then sends an invoice and tracking information to the retailer. The retailer sends along the shipping information to the customer. This finalizes the retailer\u2019s role in the order process. The customer receives the package and enjoys the water bottle. That\u2019s the supply chain in action. You can see how the retailer, wholesaler, and manufacturer all have to work together flawlessly. When done right, it\u2019s a smooth process that results in minimal work for everyone involved. One point that needs to be stressed is that you, the retailer, are responsible only for two steps: sending orders to the supplier and shipment information to the consumer. Sometimes, you\u2019ll have to be responsible for other things like customer support, but if everything goes smoothly, those two steps are the only ones you have to complete. Getting Started With Dropshipping \u00b6 All of this sounds like a complicated puzzle, but once you learn how to dropship, it\u2019s a smooth process for everyone involved. You, the dropshipping merchant, can do everything remotely and never even touch a single product! Remember that you don\u2019t need any business experience to open a dropshipping storefront. It certainly helps, but it\u2019s not necessary. Many budding entrepreneurs don\u2019t ever chase their dreams because they believe they need an MBA or years\u2019 worth of experience. This is not the case. One of the benefits of dropshipping is that you can learn how to dropship as you go. Better yet, there are numerous resources that make dropshipping easier than ever before. For example, this useful video provides some great advice on getting started. You can have absolutely zero business experience and still easily make a profit. You\u2019ll need to learn the ropes along the way, and it will be challenging at times, but it\u2019s more than worth it. The question \u201cwhat is dropshipping?\u201d and all the basic things one should know before getting started have been answered. Now it\u2019s your turn to sleeve up and turn your dropshipping business plan into action. You may start small at the beginning with uncertainty and perhaps fear of failure, but all the successful entrepreneurs used to be at the same starting point. Draw up a strategic plan, evaluate opportunities and costs, and make your business dream happen. Want to Learn More? \u00b6 What Is Dropshipping?

Dropshipping is easy to grow. As you scale up, your business model doesn\u2019t have to change very much at all. You\u2019ll have to put more work into sales and marketing as you grow, but your day-to-day will stay more or less the same. One of the benefits of dropshipping is that the costs don\u2019t skyrocket when you scale . Because of this, it\u2019s easy to keep growing at a pretty fast rate. You can do almost everything by yourself, too, unless you want to assemble a small team at some point. Dropshipping doesn\u2019t demand a lot of capital. Because starting a dropshipping business requires so little, you can get started with minimal funds. You can build an entire business right from your laptop, and you don\u2019t need to make any high-level investments. Even as your business grows, your costs will be fairly low \u2013 especially when compared to traditional business expenses. Dropshipping is flexible. This is one of its biggest benefits. You get to be your own boss and set your own rules . It\u2019s by far one of the most flexible careers that anyone can pursue. You can work from home with little more than a laptop, and you can work at the times that are most convenient for you. This is ideal for entrepreneurs who want a business that works for them. You won\u2019t have to bend over backwards to get things done. Instead, you set your own pace. Dropshipping is also flexible in that it gives you a lot of room to make decisions that work for you. You can easily list new products whenever you want, and you can adjust your strategies on the fly. If you\u2019re going on vacation, you can automate everything to run while you\u2019re away. You get the idea \u2013 the possibilities are limitless. Dropshipping is easy to manage. Since it doesn\u2019t require you to make many commitments, you can manage everything with little hassle. Once you\u2019ve found suppliers and set everything up , you\u2019re mostly only responsible for your online storefront. Disadvantages of Dropshipping","title":"\u76f4\u8fd0\u7535\u5546\u7684\u597d\u5904"},{"location":"zh/ch02/#disadvantages-of-dropshipping","text":"Dropshipping has slim margins. One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you should expect low margins initially. That\u2019s not to say it can\u2019t be profitable, but you should be aware that the product margin in some niches might be small. This issue is especially problematic when you\u2019re dropshipping in a super-competitive niche . When you\u2019re fighting for customers\u2019 attention, you can\u2019t afford to make the kind of profits you want to. If you choose the right niche, you\u2019ll see larger margins. In niches with lower competition, you\u2019ll have better margins, but at some point sales will start to plateau. That\u2019s why dropshipping relies on a fair amount of sales to be profitable. Dropshipping can make order processing difficult. Dropshipping seems straightforward: The customer orders, you process, and your supplier fulfills. And for the most part, it is simple. However, if you\u2019re sourcing products from multiple suppliers, you might run into some problems. Each of your suppliers might use a different shipping solution, which presents a problem for both you and your customers. Costs can get high, and shipping multiple products can be problematic. Different suppliers will also have different structures in place for processing and billing. Since you have to manage the interaction with your suppliers, this can get tricky. Dropshipping doesn\u2019t give you a lot of control. One of the disadvantages of dropshipping is that you don\u2019t have much control over certain aspects of the dropshipping process such as stocking products, order fulfillment, and shipping. You have to rely on your suppliers to do everything right and work seamlessly. This lack of control can be off-putting to some entrepreneurs, but it usually isn\u2019t a problem. This just means that when something goes wrong, it can be tricky to manage. While supplier problems can sometimes cause customer retention issues, you can mitigate them and keep customer churn to an absolute minimum with the right damage control. Dropshipping makes customer service more challenging. This is another problem that happens when orders go wrong or suppliers fail. Because you\u2019re just the storefront and don\u2019t have a lot of control, it can be difficult to sort out orders and handle customer support. One of the most unfortunate disadvantages of dropshipping is that you have to take the blame when your customers complain. You could be doing everything right and still run into problems if your suppliers have issues.","title":"Disadvantages of Dropshipping"},{"location":"zh/ch02/#is-dropshipping-for-you","text":"Because there are both pros and cons of dropshipping, it isn\u2019t for everyone.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step overview of the entire dropshipping process as well as a look at what the customer experiences (and why it matters). what is dropshipping","title":"The Dropshipping Process"},{"location":"zh/ch02/#understanding-the-supply-chain","text":"In this guide, you\u2019ll see the term \u201c supply chain\u201d \u201d a lot. It sounds like fancy industry lingo, but it simply refers to how a product moves from supplier to customer. We\u2019ll use this to discuss the dropshipping process. the supply chain process Image source You, the retailer, are just one piece of the puzzle. A successful dropshipping operation relies on multiple parties all working together in sync. The supply chain is exactly that: the coordination of the manufacturer, supplier, and retailer. The supply chain can be broken down into three basic steps: The manufacturer creates the products and sells them in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers. Let\u2019s say Manufacturer A makes water bottles. After the bottles roll off the production line, they\u2019re sold in bulk to suppliers and wholesalers, who turn around and resell the bottles to retailers. Suppliers and wholesalers sell the products to retailers. A retailer like yourself searches out a supplier for a specific type of product. The retailer and supplier then enter into an agreement to work together. Image source A small note here: While you can buy directly from product manufacturers, it\u2019s often much easier to purchase from suppliers instead. Most manufacturers have minimum purchase requirements that can be rather high, and you\u2019d also have to store, stock, and ship the products. So, it might seem simpler to buy straight from the manufacturer, but you\u2019ll benefit most from buying from suppliers (and dealing with the slight markup). Suppliers are also convenient because many of them specialize in a certain niche, so you can easily find the kind of products you need. This also means you can get started selling super quickly. Retailers sell the products to consumers. Suppliers and wholesalers do not sell directly to the public; that\u2019s the retailer\u2019s job. The retailer is the final step between the product and the consumer. Retailers provide online storefronts from which consumers purchase products. After the wholesaler marks up the product, the retailer marks it up yet again to arrive at the final price. By \u201cmarkup,\u201d we\u2019re referring to setting a price that covers the cost price of the item and brings you a profit. That\u2019s it! That\u2019s the entire supply chain from start to finish. It\u2019s a straightforward but crucial concept in business. You might have noticed that no one specific party was referred to as a dropshipper. That\u2019s because \u201cdropshipper\u201d is not a specific role. Dropshipping is simply the action of shipping products for someone else. Manufacturers, suppliers, and merchants can all technically be dropshippers. Later in this guide, we\u2019ll cover how to start a dropshipping retail business. In other words, you\u2019ll learn how to become the merchant that purchases products from wholesalers to sell to the public. This could mean you sell via eBay or your own website with an online storefront. Now that you know what the supply chain looks like, consider what it\u2019s like for the customer.","title":"Understanding the Supply Chain"},{"location":"zh/ch02/#dropshipping-and-customer-experiences","text":"You\u2019ve bought products online hundreds of times before, but you\u2019ve probably never thought about the experience. It\u2019s second nature for consumers. As a customer, you don\u2019t need to think about it, but as a retailer, you absolutely should. Image source Retailers can learn a lot by thinking about the ideal customer experience of ordering from a retailer. This may seem obvious, but if there are any snags in the customer experience, it could spell trouble for you as a retailer. It\u2019s important to know what your buyers expect. Let\u2019s pretend you have a business called Fancy Water Bottles, a site called FancyWaterBottles.com, and a wholesaler called Water Bottles Worldwide. Here\u2019s what the ordering process would look like from the customer\u2019s perspective: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and immediately receives an email confirmation of the purchase. After a few hours and up to a couple of days, Customer A receives a notification that their order has shipped. The notification includes tracking information, so Customer A knows exactly where their package is while en route. Customer A receives the water bottle. It\u2019s the same process you\u2019ve gone through each time you\u2019ve purchased anything online. This seems basic, but there are two important aspects of this experience. First, it\u2019s simple. All the customer has to do is order the product and pay for it. Everything else, like an order confirmation email and tracking information, is handed to them on a silver platter. And that brings us to our second point: convenience. The buying experience is extremely convenient in every way. An online purchase takes just minutes to make, and customers can browse any retailer\u2019s site at their leisure. And if all goes well, the customer won\u2019t even have to interact with anyone. It takes the minimum amount of effort to achieve the desired result of getting a product. This experience is a lot like buying a water bottle at a big box store and using the self-checkout. It\u2019s a no-fuss process that doesn\u2019t present any problems. This is a big reason why people buy online in the first place, so your storefront has to give your customers that same level of convenience. Last but not least, the customer should never notice that any other parties besides the retailer are involved. Think about it. When you buy something online, you think, \u201cI bought a water bottle from Fancy Water Bottles.\u201d You don\u2019t consider where the retailer got the product or who might be shipping your order. To make the process seamless, the customer shouldn\u2019t be aware of all the stops their product makes. The package they receive will have your retail name on it, so as far as the customer is concerned, you fulfilled and shipped the order. This is how the dropshipping process should ideally look from the customer\u2019s point of view. Now, let\u2019s break down what happens on the other end.","title":"Dropshipping and Customer Experiences"},{"location":"zh/ch02/#dropshipping-behind-the-scenes","text":"That\u2019s what the customer sees, but what is dropshipping like behind the scenes?. Here\u2019s an overview of the process: Customer A places an order for a water bottle on FancyWaterBottles.com and receives an email confirmation of the process. Let\u2019s say the total came to $14.95.Fancy Water Bottles receives the same email confirmation as well as Customer A\u2019s payment. This is usually made possible by automated software that sends out the confirmation to both buyer and seller. Fancy Water Bottles sends the order to Water Bottles Worldwide. Typically, a sales representative from Water Bottles Worldwide will receive and process the order. The retailer will then be charged for the purchase. For this example, let\u2019s say Water Bottles Worldwide charges $12.95 for each water bottle. The retailer will pay that amount, and the difference is the profit the retailer will make. In this case, the retailer will net a profit of $2.00. Water Bottles Worldwide packs up the order.Although the wholesaler ships the product, the package will be addressed from Fancy Water Bottles, and the Fancy Water Bottles name will appear on the invoice and packing slip. (This is so the customer will recognize the retailer\u2019s name on the package.) The wholesaler then sends an invoice and tracking information to the retailer. The retailer sends along the shipping information to the customer. This finalizes the retailer\u2019s role in the order process. The customer receives the package and enjoys the water bottle. That\u2019s the supply chain in action. You can see how the retailer, wholesaler, and manufacturer all have to work together flawlessly. When done right, it\u2019s a smooth process that results in minimal work for everyone involved. One point that needs to be stressed is that you, the retailer, are responsible only for two steps: sending orders to the supplier and shipment information to the consumer. Sometimes, you\u2019ll have to be responsible for other things like customer support, but if everything goes smoothly, those two steps are the only ones you have to complete.","title":"Dropshipping Behind the Scenes"},{"location":"zh/ch02/#getting-started-with-dropshipping","text":"All of this sounds like a complicated puzzle, but once you learn how to dropship, it\u2019s a smooth process for everyone involved.
