What is white labelling?

White label products are generic products mass manufactured then customized slightly (logo or brand name added, for example) for several brands. White label products can be bulk ordered, dropshipped, or printed on demand.

The term is often used interchangeably with ‚Äúprivate labelling.‚Äù But technically, there are some subtle differences. Both refer to products manufactured and then relabelled or rebranded for another store or brand. Private label, however, most often refers to products manufactured and branded before being sold exclusively by one retailer. For example, a suite of products under Walgreens‚Äô generic brand sold only at its stores.

Private labelling is generally more expensive, due to the nature of the customization and high minimums, and is best for brands that are already more established. White label products are accessible to smaller brands or those just starting up due to low, or sometimes no, minimums, as in the case of print on demand.

The benefits of white labelling

White labelling allows you to quickly spin up a business around an existing product. You can add your own touch through branding, a great website, personalized shopping experiences, and unique packaging. You don‚Äôt need to have any creative skills or manufacturing experience to sell white label products.

White labelling might be a great option if you:

    Are looking to jump on a trending product
    Want to start a business quickly 
    Don‚Äôt have a unique product idea
    Want to start a business without much upfront investment
    Aren‚Äôt interested in making or manufacturing products yourself
    Want branded supplemental products for an existing business (say, a service-based business)
    Are looking to monetize a personal or influencer brand with merch 

White label versus custom products

Blank label products sit on a wood tableMaking your own unique products from scratch can be highly rewarding. Artists, craftspeople, and product designers tend to enjoy this aspect of running a business. But it‚Äôs not for everyone. Whether you‚Äôre not creative or don‚Äôt have the time or patience for product R&D, you may opt to skip production altogether. 

The downside of white label products is that the same product may be sold under many different brand names. You can easily get lost in the shuffle. Almost any search on Amazon delivers pages and pages of identical products with different logos. You can make the most of white labelling‚Äîand stand out from other brands‚Äîby investing in a solid brand story and customer experience. Or you may compete on price or delivery options.
